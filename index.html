                    When we first started doing this, it was understandable for many candidates to not communicate with the new kids on the block. Leadership is busy, that's understandable. 
                    During our second year, we made some progress with figuring out community networking and how local politics work. Now that we're in our third year, some 
                    things are clear: The local politicians know who we are and what we're trying to accomplish. Everyone has been contacted through various means. If we 
                    don't have the info, it's because people either aren't cooperating, or there is no info to convey. So we're making the language a little more clear to 
                    reflect that, and we've added a transparency meter to our candidate pages to give readers a rough idea of who is on top of letting voters know what's up to a 
                    reasonably sufficient standard, and who isn't. Also, be sure to go into candidate's quick summaries on their candidate pages for our impressions.

          <h6 class="page-title">Read to get a quick breakdown of the 45 minute interview.</h6>

          <p>This table highlights the key topics covered in the 45 minute interview, summarizing major takeaways per section.</p>

          <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
            <p>In this interview with InformTheVoteNJ.com, Sean Pignatelli outlined his platform and philosophy for improving Downe Township through proactive leadership, better communication, and stronger community engagement.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Background and Motivation:</strong><br>
            Sean shared his personal journey from vacationing in Downe as a child to becoming a full-time resident. A personal loss in 2020 motivated him to enter politics, determined to help his neighbors and raise the standard of leadership beyond the status quo.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Key Initiatives and Projects:</strong><br>
            - <em>Dividing Creek Park:</em> Designed to be the township’s first community-owned park, providing a centralized location for family-friendly events like township-wide Easter egg hunts. The project is delayed due to township officials' focus on the Fortescue sewer project but is otherwise ready to proceed.<br>
            - <em>Newport Veterans Memorial:</em> Originally spearheaded by the Recreation Committee, the project was handed off to the Environmental and Historic Commissions. Sean emphasized the importance of honoring veterans and creating more public gathering spaces.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Transparency and Civic Engagement:</strong><br>
            - <em>Information Pipeline:</em> Sean advocates for short, digestible township newsletters funded by the Green Communities Grant, ensuring residents receive clear updates without needing to dig through complicated websites.<br>
            - <em>"Just Google It" Problem:</em> He emphasized the flaws in assuming residents can easily find information online, pointing to confusion with projects like the Newport Veterans Memorial.<br>
            - <em>Civic Education and Local Press:</em> Sean supports restoring civics education in local schools, requiring candidate information packets at election filing, and rebuilding local, nonpartisan press coverage to strengthen voter knowledge.<br>
            - <em>Technology Use:</em> Sean recognizes that modern tools like AI can streamline fact-finding and communication when used responsibly.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Senior and Family Support:</strong><br>
            - <em>Seniors (via ADRC):</em> Downe’s senior group does excellent outreach, but Sean believes key services should be available online without requiring group membership.<br>
            - <em>Young Families (via Gateway, Visiting Angels):</em> Programs exist but are poorly advertised. Sean wants better pipelines to connect families with services like utility assistance and nutrition programs.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Resident Engagement:</strong><br>
            Sean’s leadership style is highly hands-on—preferring face-to-face discussions, open-door access, and even hosting public meetings at his home. He supports anonymous suggestion dropboxes to ensure residents feel comfortable sharing feedback.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
            Sean concluded by emphasizing that collaboration between township and county officials could dramatically improve service delivery. He believes clear, basic communication fills major cracks in local government — and that robust voter education is essential to prevent situations where uninformed voting allows candidates like Charles Laspata, who ghosted the campaign, to still earn major support.</p>

                <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
                    <p>In this interview with InformTheVoteNJ.com, Sean Pignatelli outlined his platform and philosophy for improving Downe Township through proactive leadership, better communication, and stronger community engagement.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Background and Motivation:</strong><br>
                    Sean shared his personal journey from vacationing in Downe as a child to becoming a full-time resident. A personal loss in 2020 motivated him to enter politics, determined to help his neighbors and raise the standard of leadership beyond the status quo.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Key Initiatives and Projects:</strong><br>
                    - <em>Dividing Creek Park:</em> Designed to be the township’s first community-owned park, providing a centralized location for family-friendly events like township-wide Easter egg hunts. The project is delayed due to township officials' focus on the Fortescue sewer project but is otherwise ready to proceed.<br>
                    - <em>Newport Veterans Memorial:</em> Originally spearheaded by the Recreation Committee, the project was handed off to the Environmental and Historic Commissions. Sean emphasized the importance of honoring veterans and creating more public gathering spaces.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Transparency and Civic Engagement:</strong><br>
                    - <em>Information Pipeline:</em> Sean advocates for short, digestible township newsletters funded by the Green Communities Grant, ensuring residents receive clear updates without needing to dig through complicated websites.<br>
                    - <em>"Just Google It" Problem:</em> He emphasized the flaws in assuming residents can easily find information online, pointing to confusion with projects like the Newport Veterans Memorial.<br>
                    - <em>Civic Education and Local Press:</em> Sean supports restoring civics education in local schools, requiring candidate information packets at election filing, and rebuilding local, nonpartisan press coverage to strengthen voter knowledge.<br>
                    - <em>Technology Use:</em> Sean recognizes that modern tools like AI can streamline fact-finding and communication when used responsibly.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Senior and Family Support:</strong><br>
                    - <em>Seniors (via ADRC):</em> Downe’s senior group does excellent outreach, but Sean believes key services should be available online without requiring group membership.<br>
                    - <em>Young Families (via Gateway, Visiting Angels):</em> Programs exist but are poorly advertised. Sean wants better pipelines to connect families with services like utility assistance and nutrition programs.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Resident Engagement:</strong><br>
                    Sean’s leadership style is highly hands-on—preferring face-to-face discussions, open-door access, and even hosting public meetings at his home. He supports anonymous suggestion dropboxes to ensure residents feel comfortable sharing feedback.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
                    Sean concluded by emphasizing that collaboration between township and county officials could dramatically improve service delivery. He believes clear, basic communication fills major cracks in local government — and that robust voter education is essential to prevent situations where uninformed voting allows candidates like Charles Laspata, who ghosted the campaign, to still earn major support.</p>

                    <p>In this updated 2025 interview with <strong>InformTheVoteNJ.com</strong>, Lawrence Township Committee candidate <strong>Charlie Woody</strong> expands on his 
                        campaign platform, emphasizing transparency, accountability, youth engagement, and the urgent need for functional government. This follow-up builds on last 
                        year's interview, responding to new developments and his primary race against incumbent John Tisa.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Concerns About Leadership Attendance and Communication:</strong><br>
                    Charlie raised early concerns about the absence of the current mayor from multiple township meetings and the lack of public notification. A particularly short 
                    meeting with only one committeeman in attendance raised flags for him about unequal access to information. He questioned why only certain long-time residents 
                    seemed aware that the meeting would be cut short, highlighting a lack of transparency and consistency in township communication.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Website Issues and Digital Transparency:</strong><br>
                    Woody was blunt about the township’s poorly maintained website, citing outdated content, broken contact numbers, and a lack of public meeting minutes. He 
                    criticized the $16,000 annual payment to CDC for web services (correction: it appears as though website maintenance is one of many services CDC provides) and 
                    vowed to push for better accountability and, if needed, replacement of the vendor within 90 days if elected. He acknowledged that improvements have started, 
                    but attributes them to public pressure, including his own vocal advocacy.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>TextMyGov Rollout:</strong><br>
                    While cautiously optimistic about the new “TextMyGov” platform, which will allow residents to text the clerk with concerns and receive alerts, Charlie noted 
                    that it is an added expense—not a replacement for the website—and stressed the importance of evaluating its effectiveness before renewing the contract after 
                    two years.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Transparency, Forums, and the “Good Ol’ Boys Club”:</strong><br>
                    Charlie criticized opponent John Tisa for refusing to participate in interviews, forums, or sharing any campaign information at all... framing this as emblematic 
                    of an insider political culture that hand-picks successors rather than allowing open competition. He recounted how Tisa initially pledged neutrality in last 
                    year’s race but later supported Charlie’s opponent. Woody says this reveals a deeper issue in township politics: gatekeeping, loyalty-based endorsements, and a 
                    lack of real dialogue with the public.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Financial Crisis and Calls for a Plan:</strong><br>
                    Woody revealed that the township may be approaching bankruptcy, something he says residents were never formally told. He believes it’s unacceptable that the 
                    public isn’t informed of such dire financial conditions and questions what Tisa has done during his term to address the situation. Woody emphasized the need 
                    for a clear financial recovery plan and drew parallels to managing a failing business, arguing that elected officials must be held to a higher standard.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Rumors, Respect, and a Toxic Climate:</strong><br>
                    Charlie directly addressed a rumor that he sabotaged a nonprofit's gaming license, strongly denying any involvement and framing it as politically motivated 
                    misinformation. He condemned the spread of personal attacks and called for township leadership to denounce such behavior—regardless of whom it targets. He 
                    stressed that he's willing to meet with anyone civilly, whether they support him or not, as long as the goal is to serve the township.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Youth Engagement and Community Building:</strong><br>
                    In a shift toward constructive ideas, Woody proposed the creation of a skate park and other community spaces to re-engage youth and families. He also suggested 
                    creating a summer internship for high school seniors interested in government, coordinated through the township and local schools. Woody emphasized that these 
                    initiatives wouldn’t require raising taxes, pointing to available grants and unused resources as potential funding sources.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Local Civics, County Involvement, and Better Election Practices:</strong><br>
                    Discussing broader civic issues, Woody supported InformTheVoteNJ’s push for civics education in schools, regular candidate information packets, and a greater 
                    role for counties in helping voters learn about their choices. He agreed that the current candidate filing process lacks transparency and that voters should 
                    have better access to biographical and qualification-based information about candidates.</p>
    
                    <p><strong>Local Press and Civic Transparency:</strong><br>
                    Charlie and the interviewer explored the lack of trustworthy, nonpartisan local press coverage. Charlie praised Steven Solof’s efforts with InformTheVoteNJ, 
                    saying they’ve filled a critical gap in local political coverage. While acknowledging some progress—like efforts from Commissioner Director Sauro and 
                    journalist Joseph Smith—he stressed that reliable, centralized reporting is still lacking. Charlie supports efforts to formalize candidate information 
                    sharing and newsletters to keep residents informed year-round.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>County Road 553 and Cedar Lake Dam:</strong><br>
                    A major ongoing concern is the deteriorating condition of County Road 553, compromised by the failing Cedar Dam. Charlie explained the bureaucratic 
                    finger-pointing between the township and the county over ownership responsibilities and repair costs. Although some sidewalk work was completed recently, 
                    Charlie said county engineers have ignored multiple emails and calls for updates. He promised that if elected, his first 100 days would include getting 
                    definitive answers and making them public. He stressed that taxpayers deserve more than silence and vowed to show up in person to get clarity.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>393 Main Street Development:</strong><br>
                    Turning to a more positive topic, Charlie described his evolution from skeptic to supporter of a new pool manufacturing facility at 393 Main Street. After 
                    meeting with the owner, touring the facility, and reviewing environmental precautions—including upgraded smokestacks and sound barriers—Charlie praised the 
                    company’s responsiveness and transparency. He posted the walkthrough video on his website, viewing the development as a net benefit for local ratables and 
                    community relations.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Quarterly Newsletters and Meeting Agendas:</strong><br>
                    Charlie endorsed the idea of township-run quarterly newsletters and consistent agenda postings. He recalled past efforts where residents received yearly 
                    township updates and urged the return of these efforts. Charlie argued that regular communication—whether via printed flyers or digital formats—can reduce 
                    misinformation and increase community participation in planning board meetings and decisions.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Bay Point Beach Project:</strong><br>
                    Charlie also highlighted the $12 million Bay Point Beach renovation funded by a state grant. The project enhanced public access while preserving wildlife and 
                    environmental safeguards. Although a ribbon-cutting ceremony has not yet occurred, he praised the work and invited residents to enjoy the improved waterfront area.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Election Integrity and Republican Party Friction:</strong><br>
                    Charlie revisited last year’s election controversy, where he was initially certified the winner, only to have the certification rescinded days later due to 
                    alleged tabulation errors involving mail-in ballots. He claims party leadership had already decided to back his opponent and that he was pressured to drop out, 
                    even offered a spot on the Planning Board in exchange. Despite feeling politically sidelined, Charlie emphasized that he remains committed to serving all 
                    residents, even those who dislike or oppose him.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Breaking the “Good Ol’ Boys Club”:</strong><br>
                    Charlie framed his campaign as a grassroots effort against entrenched power, accusing current leadership of resisting change and transparency. He called for 
                    fresh ideas and younger leadership, not out of rebellion, but out of necessity—pointing to financial mismanagement and outdated practices.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Personal Outreach and Mutual Aid Proposal:</strong><br>
                    In closing, Charlie detailed how he has already helped township residents resolve heating emergencies, property complaints, and assistance applications—even 
                    without holding office. He proposed donating 50% of his salary if elected to create a resident support fund for neighbors in need. This, he says, reflects his 
                    philosophy of service: “I’m not running against the people—I’m running for them.”</p>

                <p>At Inform the Vote, our mission is to establish a new standard of
                civic engagement by equipping you—the citizen—with thoroughly 
                researched, unbiased, and easily digestible information.</p>

                <p>We believe an empowered citizenry is the cornerstone of a 
                transparent and accountable local government. Yet, in an era 
                where this should be the norm, both transparency and 
                accountability often fall short. We're here to challenge this 
                status quo.</p>

                <p>Our platform is designed to streamline and consolidate the 
                essential information you need to become an informed voter, 
                breaking down the barriers that often deter civic participation
                 in a process that can and should be more straightforward.</p>
