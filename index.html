          <p>
            With the shutting down of newspapers all across the country, information regarding elections is scattered all over the internet and oftentimes appears biased because
            it is coming from the candidates themselves and their parties. We've scoured the information landscape and consolidated it on this hub, with a focus on New Jersey,
            and more specifically Cumberland County. This year Cumberland County has 5 primary elections:
         </p>

         <ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong><a href="/child_pages/cc-elections/cc_demprimary_county_commissioner_2024.html">Cumberland County Democrat Primary For 2 Commissioner Seats</a></strong></li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong><a href="/child_pages/cc-elections/us_repubprimary_senate.html">Republican Primary for 1 US Senate Seat</a></strong></li>

            <li><strong><a href="/child_pages/cc-elections/us_demprimary_senate.html">Democrat Primary for 1 US Senate Seat</a></strong></li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong><a href="/child_pages/cc-elections/us_houseofrepresentatives_demprimary.html">Democrat Primary for 1 US House of Representatives Seat</a></strong></li>

            <li><strong><a href="/child_pages/cc-elections/us_president_demprimary.html">Democrat Primary for US President</a></strong></li>
            <br>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Click on the primary election you're interested in and navigate the interactive primary ballots to learn more about the 
            candidates. We've provided summaries as there is a lot of information to digest. We suggest skimming the summaries and the 
            candidate pages we've provided to help streamline the process. However, all official campaign pages and social media links are provided 
            to ensure access to the full amount of information and to verify any of our info. Don't forget to use the back 
            button on your computer or phone to get back to the ballot, and there's also the red, three-lined 'hamburger' menu at the top 
            left of the screen to help broader
            navigation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Given that we spend a lot of time researching and analyzing voting information, there is a good chance we are making observations the 
            average constituent might not make. We invite you to take a look at our 
            <a href="https://www.informthevotenj.com/child_pages/cc-elections/unanswered_questions">Unanswered Questions</a> page to help bring 
            awareness to potential gaps in information regarding our county elections. That being said, there are also a lot of things we might miss. 
            So if you'd like to help contribute, please join our <a href="https://www.informthevotenj.com/child_pages/cc-elections/unanswered_questions">Facebook Group.</a>
