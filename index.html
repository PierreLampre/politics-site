                    As we shift from the primary to the general election season, this site is currently in a transitional phase. Over the next month or so, some pages may still reflect 
                    outdated primary content, and candidate information for the general election may appear incomplete.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is expected. It’s still early in the season, and many candidates are just beginning to shape their campaigns. We're also waiting on official materials — including 
                    full candidate lists and contact info from sources like the Millville City Clerk — before building out new pages.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While that information trickles in, we’re using this time to raise awareness of the project:

                    <p>
                      When I first started InformTheVoteNJ, it became clear that local election information wasn’t hard to understand — it was just hard to <em>find</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Some candidates had websites. Others posted sporadically on social media. A few only spoke during committee meetings. There was no centralized pipeline, and voters were left to piece things together. My goal is to make those connections clearer, easier, and more consistent than when I started — no matter where you like to tune in.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.2em;">🧭 Different Tools for Different People</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      Not everyone uses technology the same way. So instead of expecting voters to all follow one channel, I’m using a mix of formats:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>📬 <strong>Email Newsletters (Substack):</strong> for people who avoid social media</li>
                      <br>
                      <li>🎥 <strong>YouTube:</strong> for people who prefer video content and interviews</li>
                      <br>
                      <li>💬 <strong>Facebook Group:</strong> for those who like ongoing posts and discussion threads</li>
                      <br>
                      <li>🌐 <strong>This Website:</strong> for structured, long-term reference</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each of these serves a different type of voter — and that’s important.</p>
                    
                    <h4 style="margin-top: 1.2em;">📌 The Website Is the Final Destination</h4>
                    <p>
                      While it’s great when voters follow along year-round, the reality is: people are busy. Not everyone has time to stay engaged every week. That’s why the website matters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When primary or general elections are near, voters deserve a reliable place to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Catch up on what happened during the campaign season</li>
                      <li>Compare candidate messaging with real issue summaries</li>
                      <li>Make confident, informed choices without going down every rabbit hole</li>

          <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
            <p>In this wide-ranging and insightful interview, Larae Smith shares her deep local roots, extensive civic leadership, and motivations for seeking a seat on the Cumberland 
                County Board of Commissioners. She calls for greater government transparency through simplified information sharing, advocates for rebuilding local press, and champions 
                the reintroduction of civics education to increase voter engagement. Smith also addresses urgent policy challenges including the homelessness crisis, post-COVID education 
                gaps, and looming service cuts. She emphasizes the need for action-oriented planning, stronger volunteer networks, and leveraging community assets—from retired 
                professionals to youth leaders. On infrastructure, Smith offers candid commentary on stalled projects like the Nabb Ave Extension and middle-mile broadband expansion, 
                while raising the potential of grassroots ballot initiatives and tourism partnerships as tools for revitalizing Cumberland County.</p>

              <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
                <p>In this full-length interview, NJ Republican gubernatorial candidate Justin Barbera shares his background as a father of three and contractor, and outlines his grassroots 
                  campaign to bring practical, conservative leadership to Trenton. Hosted by Steven Solof of InformTheVoteNJ.com, the conversation covers Barbera’s key platform pillars—ending 
                  sanctuary policies and supporting ICE, cracking down on government waste and corrupt contracts, restoring practical education like trades and civics, securing elections 
                  through paper ballots, reducing healthcare and insurance costs using NJ’s population scale, and defending gun rights with expanded Second Amendment protections. Barbera 
                  emphasizes his connections to South Jersey, citing family property in Cumberland County and local engagement efforts, and proposes infrastructure improvements like broadband 
                  expansion and recycled asphalt roadwork. He advocates for better civic awareness through county-run voter info platforms and calls for NJ colleges to help rebuild local press 
                  by assigning journalism students to political coverage. Barbera presents himself as an unbought outsider committed to restoring common sense, empowering working families, and 
                  shaking up the state’s political establishment.</p>

Although the Cumberland County Regular Republican Organization provides a platform bio outlining some of Albrecht’s stances, he does not have a dedicated campaign website. This interview is intended to go deeper—giving voters a chance to hear him explain his work in his own words.</p>
              
                  <p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility and Measurable Results:</strong><br>
                  Albrecht discusses key strategies like holding the line on taxes for three consecutive years while highlighting improvements in public health rankings and infrastructure upgrades across the county.</p>
              
                  <p><strong>Modernization and Emergency Response:</strong><br>
                  The conversation touches on efforts to stabilize core county functions, expand broadband access in rural areas, and respond to public emergencies effectively. Projects like the Middle Mile fiber initiative and South Ave Culvert are explored in detail.</p>
              
                  <p><strong>Transparency and Public Communication:</strong><br>
                  Steven introduces the idea of a quarterly report to help bridge the information gap between elected officials and residents. Albrecht agrees this could improve public understanding and address the challenge of under-communicated government work.</p>
              
                  <p><strong>Civic Engagement and Education:</strong><br>
                  Albrecht emphasizes the importance of teaching local civics in schools, instilling a deeper sense of pride in community participation and awareness of how county government impacts daily life.</p>
              
                  <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
                  Whether you're lightly engaged or ready to go down the rabbit hole, this interview offers a rare, direct window into the mindset and leadership style of one of Cumberland County’s long-serving commissioners. It's a valuable listen for anyone curious about what’s being done—and what could still be improved—in county government.</p>

                <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
                    <p>In this interview with InformTheVoteNJ.com, Sean Pignatelli outlined his platform and philosophy for improving Downe Township through proactive leadership, better communication, and stronger community engagement.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Background and Motivation:</strong><br>
                    Sean shared his personal journey from vacationing in Downe as a child to becoming a full-time resident. A personal loss in 2020 motivated him to enter politics, determined to help his neighbors and raise the standard of leadership beyond the status quo.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Key Initiatives and Projects:</strong><br>
                    - <em>Dividing Creek Park:</em> Designed to be the township’s first community-owned park, providing a centralized location for family-friendly events like township-wide Easter egg hunts. The project is delayed due to township officials' focus on the Fortescue sewer project but is otherwise ready to proceed.<br>
                    - <em>Newport Veterans Memorial:</em> Originally spearheaded by the Recreation Committee, the project was handed off to the Environmental and Historic Commissions. Sean emphasized the importance of honoring veterans and creating more public gathering spaces.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Transparency and Civic Engagement:</strong><br>
                    - <em>Information Pipeline:</em> Sean advocates for short, digestible township newsletters funded by the Green Communities Grant, ensuring residents receive clear updates without needing to dig through complicated websites.<br>
                    - <em>"Just Google It" Problem:</em> He emphasized the flaws in assuming residents can easily find information online, pointing to confusion with projects like the Newport Veterans Memorial.<br>
                    - <em>Civic Education and Local Press:</em> Sean supports restoring civics education in local schools, requiring candidate information packets at election filing, and rebuilding local, nonpartisan press coverage to strengthen voter knowledge.<br>
                    - <em>Technology Use:</em> Sean recognizes that modern tools like AI can streamline fact-finding and communication when used responsibly.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Senior and Family Support:</strong><br>
                    - <em>Seniors (via ADRC):</em> Downe’s senior group does excellent outreach, but Sean believes key services should be available online without requiring group membership.<br>
                    - <em>Young Families (via Gateway, Visiting Angels):</em> Programs exist but are poorly advertised. Sean wants better pipelines to connect families with services like utility assistance and nutrition programs.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Resident Engagement:</strong><br>
                    Sean’s leadership style is highly hands-on—preferring face-to-face discussions, open-door access, and even hosting public meetings at his home. He supports anonymous suggestion dropboxes to ensure residents feel comfortable sharing feedback.</p>
                
                    <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
                    Sean concluded by emphasizing that collaboration between township and county officials could dramatically improve service delivery. He believes clear, basic communication fills major cracks in local government — and that robust voter education is essential to prevent situations where uninformed voting allows candidates like Charles Laspata, who ghosted the campaign, to still earn major support.</p>

                <p>At Inform the Vote, our mission is to establish a new standard of
                civic engagement by equipping you—the citizen—with thoroughly 
                researched, unbiased, and easily digestible information.</p>

                <p>We believe an empowered citizenry is the cornerstone of a 
                transparent and accountable local government. Yet, in an era 
                where this should be the norm, both transparency and 
                accountability often fall short. We're here to challenge this 
                status quo.</p>

                <p>Our platform is designed to streamline and consolidate the 
                essential information you need to become an informed voter, 
                breaking down the barriers that often deter civic participation
                 in a process that can and should be more straightforward.</p>
