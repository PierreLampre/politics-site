  <!-- SUMMARY -->
  <section class="primer" id="summary">
    <h1>Laurel Lake Fire & Rescue — Commercial Township Fire District 3</h1>
    <p class="small">
      <b>Quick summary:</b> Laurel Lake Fire & Rescue has <b>two seats open</b> for the 2026 election, with
      <b>Janet Campbell</b> and <b>Larry Coffman</b> running for re-election. Outreach has been sent, but no
      responses have been received so far. There appears to be <b>budget approval</b> on the ballot this year,
      though official wording has not yet been obtained. There may also be a ballot question related to
      <b>LOSAP (Length of Service Award Program)</b>. Additional clarification may be available at the next
      scheduled meeting on <b>February 8</b>.

    <h2>Ballot Questions</h2>

    <a href="https://www.commercialtwpbofc3.com/about-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sourced from the district's website</a>

    <h3>Here are some further explanations of the ballot questions sourced from correspondence with Kacy Catalano, the fire district secretary</h3>

    <details>
      <summary>Budget approval clarification</summary>
      <p class="small">
        This is the same levy as last year.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Capital outlay clarification</summary>
      <p class="small">
        The SCBA packs and bottles are pieces of necessary pieces of equipment that ought/need to be replaced. The money is already available in related accounts and the 
        district has made plans to save moving forward on a quarterly basis to help manage the payouts incrementally. The district simply needs public approval.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>LOSAP points system clarification</summary>
      <p class="small">
        The reason for the change is that the current system is based on percentages and, from Kacy's perspective, was not adhered to historically. The new system is meant to help 
        recruit and retain volunteers through a well defined, transparent, and publicized program. 
      </p>

  <!-- ISSUES -->
  <section class="card" id="issues">
    <h2>Issues</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>District-specific issues</summary>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li><b>Bank communication:</b> The district has had difficulty communicating with TD Bank without an authorized representative making the call.</li>
        <li><b>Fuel costs:</b> Laurel Lake appears to cover fuel expenses for other fire districts within Commercial Township.</li>
        <li><b>Water testing:</b> There is an ongoing issue involving coliform detection, which is expected to be followed up.</li>
        <li><b>Website maintenance:</b> Maintenance issues appear to be resolving through the use of outside assistance.</li>
        <li><b>Bed Bugs:</b>Apparently there is a recurring issue with some people who are being rescued bringing bed bugs along with them to the station. Discussions were had about how to handle it more efficiently moving forward.</li>
        <li><b>Body Cameras:</b>Suggestions were made to have firefighters and EMS personnel wear body cameras to have documentation ready should lawsuits arrive regarding potential future allegations </li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>County-wide issues (applies to all districts)</summary>
        <div class="inside">
          <ul class="clean">
            <li><b>Staffing:</b> Most, if not all, districts need more firefighters and EMS personnel.</li>
            <li><b>Volunteer model vs affordability:</b> The use of volunteers versus the cost of living and affordability situations should be discussed.</li>
            <li><b>Turnout:</b> Low voter turnout should be re-discussed, as it calls into question the strength of election processes.</li>
            <li><b>Visibility gap:</b> Lack of public attendance and press coverage of meetings leaves the public and voters in the dark regarding essential emergency services.</li>
            <li><b>Website/Social Media Maintenance: Online information not being updated or not even existing leads to lack of coordination for the public to know meeting days/times/locations, meeting minutes missing, underutilized social media marketing opportunities, etc.</b></li>
            <li><b>Legal Notice vs Meaningful Notice:</b> Traditionally, public meetings across the county only needed to be advertised in one or two newspapers. As the digital age takes over, there is a push to publish on websites, but is that enough?</li>
            <li><b>EMS uncertainty:</b> The ongoing Inspira contract discussions leaves districts in limbo about how to handle EMS coverage on a long term vision.</li>
            <li><b>Radio programming:</b> The lack of a radio programmer hinders inter-county communication during mutual aid endeavors.</li>
          </ul>

  <!-- COVERAGE INSIGHTS -->
<section class="card">
  <h2>Coverage Insights</h2>

  <details open>
    <summary>What this coverage revealed</summary>
    <ul class="clean">
      <li>
        <b>High level of cooperation and accessibility:</b> District leadership was consistently responsive and willing to engage, with Kacy Catalano serving as a primary point of contact throughout the process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Direct participation improved accuracy:</b> Kacy participated in a full one-hour radio interview, attended the informational forum, and regularly followed up to help close knowledge gaps and verify details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Demonstrates the value of communication:</b> Clear, consistent coordination made it easier to correct errors, update website information, and reduce public confusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Commissioner recruitment challenges:</b> One commissioner was asked to fill a vacant seat with little or no prior firefighting or fire district experience, underscoring how difficult it can be to recruit board members.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Administrative burden remains high:</b> Even with strong leadership and engagement, districts routinely juggle operational, staffing, and governance issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Broader takeaway:</b> This district shows how much progress is possible with transparency and coordination—but also how fragile the system can be when it relies heavily on a small number of engaged individuals.
      </li>
    </ul>
