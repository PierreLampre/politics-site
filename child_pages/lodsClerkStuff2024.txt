              <h6 class="page-title">Victoria Lods</h6>
              <p>
                Commissioner Lods is running as a challenger against Celeste Riley for the County Clerk seat. She has been involved in politics for decades, having previously held positions 
                such as Chief of Staff for a State Senator and she was the Executive Director for Habitat for Humanity. She is currently a County Commissioner. At a recent Republican breakfast 
                meeting, Lods pointed out several things that could be seen as why she is running for the position and how she differentiates herself from the incumbent:
                <br>
                1. Competence for the role of County Clerk is important because they are responsible for elections and could make election related errors. The following might be an 
                example of this: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/781111154116727/?multi_permalinks=850813927146449&ref=share">NJ Globe Article</a>
                <br>
                2. It is important for the Clerk to actually show up for work on a regular basis and not focus on peripheral tasks such as ribbon cuttings.
                <br>
                3. It is common for administrative politicians to make excuses for why things aren't getting done, like broken printers in the office.
                <br>       
                4. Appropriate execution of job duties is important. For example, the current clerk has recused herself from election duties, but has her 
                picture on election information mailers. So two questions arise: 1. How can she recuse herself from one of her most important duties? 
                2. Why would her picture appear on mailers that are meant to present neutral voting information (election date, how to vote early, etc.)?

                When asked in person about what the specific role is of the County Clerk and how she would differentiate herself from the incumbent, she responded "If you don't
                know what the County Clerk does, that should tell you enough about how the role is being executed.", which I believe implies that the County Clerk should be 
                acting as the known liason between the public and the government. She also released the following video to help clarify the 
                role of the clerk:

            To be clear, with the lack of a proper newspaper providing thorough, professional-level election coverage, both sides of the aisle in *local* 
            politics seem to be suffering from a lack of clear messaging. This is not to say that they aren't putting forward a lot of effort to message, 
            but the information is oftentimes scattered across the internet, spoken about at meetings/events that appear partisan or have expensive 
            sponsorship fees, or mentioned at lengthy meetings most people simply won't attend. Oftentimes people get brief literature like

            While we have been able to gather some specific information about Lods run for County Clerk, as shown by the above agenda and our references 
            to the issues surrounding the ballot design and election mailers from the clerk's office, there is probably a lot more detail that we could go 
            into about the specifics of the clerk's office and Lods campaign bid.

            The one general point that the party has made clear regarding the local level, is that the Democrat party has been predominantly in control for 
            the past 40 odd years, and they have made a mess while doing so, so perhaps it is time to let the Republicans take control for a while so they
