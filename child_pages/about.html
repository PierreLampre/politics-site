                    <br>

                    As a citizen who started with genuine curiosity about our upcoming election candidates,
                I found myself increasingly concerned about the state of our local elections. The
                concern eventually boils down to: Our citizens should be ‘fully informed’ rather than
                ‘slightly informed’ regarding elections, especially when pro-actively seeking out the
                information. <a href="#our-process">(see Our Process)</a> I believe that an informed, participatory citizenry is the
                cornerstone of any functioning democracy. Given the resources and technology
                available in 2023, there should already be a comprehensive system in place for
                informing voters well ahead of election day. This system should deliver essential, easy-
                to-digest information about candidates, issues, and voting procedures so that citizens
                can make well-informed decisions. If we fail to meet these minimum standards, we risk
                undermining the integrity of our elections.

                <h3 class="op-subheading">The Beginning: Phase 1</h3>
                    <div class="op-section">
                        When I received my sample primary ballot in the mail, I naturally assumed there would
                        be a straightforward way to learn about the candidates. To my surprise, the ballot
                        provided no direct link or website for candidate-related information. Rooted in the belief
                        that in our modern, information-rich society, finding basic details about those running for
                        public office should be a simple task, I initiated a general Google search. I fully
                        expected a plethora of easily accessible information. That was not the case. Furthering
                        my efforts, I directly reached out to the candidates but was met with just one insufficient
                        response.
                    </div>
                <h3 class="op-subheading">The Beginning: Phase 2 - Frustration</h3>
                    <div class="op-section">
                        After the primary election, what began as reasonable curiosity morphed into reasonable
                        concern. I expended almost a month trying to reach out to the candidates through all
                        conceivable avenues: emails, social media, phone numbers, mailing addresses, and
                        even the local newspaper. I still came up empty-handed. This underscored the fact that
                        the existing system was woefully inadequate for a citizen genuinely interested in making
                        an informed vote.
                    </div>
                <h3 class="op-subheading">Hope</h3>
                    <div class="op-section">
                        Thankfully, I thought of contacting the mayor, who was accessible,
                        communicative, and helpful. He understood the need to
                        reach out to the political parties and request more accessibility. This led to the
                        republican party reaching out to me to suggest their website, which I already knew
                        about and was insufficient. However, I remembered they had an upcoming bi-weekly
                        breakfast and was able to confirm that those breakfasts are in fact open to the public
                        (with RSVP and $15 cover).
                        This breakfast was a good way to get myself more involved directly in the process.
                        However, keep in mind that by this point, showing up at this breakfast was basically like
                        starting at day 1 to inform my vote, even though I had already spent 6 weeks looking for
                        information. Not only this, but as any newcomer to a group or organization, that
                        breakfast was basically my chance to say hello and briefly talk about a few issues. This
                        is not the robust, comprehensive source of information I need to make an informed vote,
                        it’s just an introduction.
                        Someone at the breakfast mentioned Deerfield Day, an event where the republicans
                        and democrats would be available to talk at length…. But literally later that same
                        afternoon. Thankfully, I had the afternoon off and was available. This event was
                        probably the real beginning of me having at least some idea of what was going on and
                        having enough time to speak at length with any of the 16 candidates running for

                        office…. Nearly six weeks after starting the process. Even with that being
                        acknowledged, about only a handful of the 16 candidates were present during the
                        nearly 2 hours I was there.
                        As I continued this process, it became clear that being available for such last-minute
                        engagements and persistent searching for basic information isn&#39;t something the average
                        citizen could easily do. The system should not require voters to go above and beyond to
                        become informed.
                    </div>
                <h3 class="op-subheading">The Struggle Continued</h3>
                    <div class="op-section">
                        Over the next month, I decided to show up to public events in the hopes that literal
                        attendance would increase my involvement, and then hopefully increase my election
                        based knowledge. I attended commissioner meetings to gain an understanding of
                        current county issues like The Middle Mile grant, water/sewage modernization, and the
                        Nabb Ave extension. While these meetings were informative in general, they failed to
                        help me understand where the various candidates stood on these issues, except for a
                        few incumbents and candidates who happened to be present. I also attended local
                        events like food festivals and winery promotions, as sometimes candidates will show up
                        to engage with the community. These events were disappointments; they provided no
                        insight into the elections as they are not set up for direct interaction with voters seeking
                        information about candidates. Despite my best efforts, I realized I was only becoming
                        &quot;slightly informed&quot; rather than &quot;fully informed,&quot; and this is where the system fails us. The
                        standard should be for voters to be &quot;fully informed,&quot; and anything less undermines the
                        democratic process. Without regularly scheduled, focused events and a centralized
                        information hub, the cycle of gaps in knowledge and participation continues. At one point when attempting
                        to attend a Democrat meet and greet, I was immediately confronted and told that I was not welcome because 
                        "I ask too many questions." It seems as though the county is content with going through the motions of having 
                        an election, making sure all the i’s are dotted and t’s crossed regarding the appearance of a quality
                        election, without making sure the public is actually informed.

            <div class="our-suggestion-content">
                <div class="os-section">
                    Given the gaping holes in the current system, it&#39;s clear that piecemeal efforts to keep
                    citizens informed are not sufficient. It&#39;s time for legislative action to standardize and
                    enforce a more robust, transparent electoral process. We propose the drafting of a
                    comprehensive bill that codifies the aforementioned standards into law.
                </div>
                <ol class="os-ol">
                    <h4 class="os-subheading">Here's what the bill would aim to accomplish:</h4>
                    <li class="os-li"><strong>Centralized Information Hub:</strong> A government-run or government-endorsed platform
                        that provides comprehensive information on all candidates running in county elections.</li>
                    <li class="os-li"><strong>Timely and Accessible Information:</strong> The bill would mandate that all relevant election
                        information be made available at least one month prior to any election and that updates
                        are provided on a regular, monthly basis during campaign seasons. This would include
                        providing links to this information in all official election communications, such as sample
                        ballots, as well as on various marketing mediums.</li>
                    <li class="os-li"><strong>Mandatory Public Appearances:</strong> All candidates would be required to make at least
                        one public appearance per month focused on in-depth interaction with citizens. These
                        events should not be routine commissioner meetings or casual county events but
                        should be aimed explicitly at informing voters.</li>
                    <li class="os-li"><strong>Accountability Mechanisms:</strong> The bill would also introduce stringent oversight and
                        accountability measures, including the possibility of fines or voiding an election, to
                        ensure compliance with these new standards.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="os-section">
                    Instituting these requirements by law would eliminate the guesswork and frustration
                    many voters face, raising the standard from &quot;slightly informed&quot; to &quot;fully informed.&quot; By
                    setting this as the new baseline, we can fortify the integrity of our electoral process,
                    ensuring that it truly reflects the will of an informed electorate.
