                    Navigating the labyrinth of local politics can be a daunting task. The process of gathering 
                    all the information on this site involved many hours of research, attending numerous events, 
                    attempting to contact many people, and sorting through a myriad of websites. Our objective in 
                    providing these streamlined suggestions is simple: to help you become a fully informed voter 
                    without going through the same time-consuming, often frustrating process we did. The steps

                            <strong>Study the Candidates:</strong> The most straightforward way to understand who's running and what 
                            they stand for is by checking out our consolidated Candidates page. To our knowledge, this is the most 
                            efficient means to learn about local candidates. We've included the elections that are more statewide and national,
                            as they are related to local elections, and why not have as much info on one consolidated website? Also, be sure to pro-actively 
                            follow the candidates on social media to stay up to date. And by pro-actively I mean set aside time once every few weeks to check
                            their pages, because simply clicking the follow buttons may lead to posts getting lost in the clutter, or
                            even missing shadow-banned posts.

                            <strong>Internalize the Popular Issues:</strong> Before you can assess a candidate's suitability, you need 
                            to know where you stand on the key issues. Our Issues page offers a comprehensive overview of ongoing and 
                            popular issues at the county and state level. This will help you prepare questions for the candidates and 
                            understand what matters most to you.

                                    <strong>Bi-weekly Republican Party Breakfast at Eastlyn Golf Course:</strong> This suggestion isn't meant to be partisan; it's based on 
                                    the frequency and consistency of these events. At these Saturday morning gatherings, you can hear their local messaging, meet Republican 
                                    candidates and ask them election-related questions. There's currently no comparable event for Democrats, as they haven't posted any events 
                                    on <a href="https://cumberlandnjdems.com/events/">their website</a> in quite some time. Alternatively, you can scour their

                                    tend to get buried among the messaging posts, with notice to events oftentimes being less than a week or even sometimes less than a day.

                                    <strong>County Commissioner Meetings:</strong> These meetings are a great way to understand how 
                                    local government functions and what issues are currently at the forefront. Each meeting has a 
                                    'public comments' section, allowing you to actively participate. Prepare your questions and bring 
                                    a notebook to jot down important points. They are usually held at the administration building at 164 West Broad Street in Bridgeton,
                                    at 6pm, but sometimes they move around. We post some of these on our events calendar, but be sure to double check the

                                    <strong>Casual County Events:</strong> Events like Deerfield Day give you a chance to interact with candidates, even if the main focus 
                                    isn't on the upcoming election. However, these events are often poorly advertised by political candidates, which we hope to change.

                                    <strong>Miscellaneous County Department Meetings:</strong> These meetings can offer a deeper dive into the workings of the county. While they may not 
                                    directly relate to the upcoming election, they provide context for larger political issues and can be beneficial for those with extra time and curiosity.
                                    They can also sometimes highlight some of the key issues going on throughout the county.
