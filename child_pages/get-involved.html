                    Navigating the labyrinth of local politics can be a daunting task. The process of gathering 
                    all the information on this site involved many hours of research, attending numerous events, 
                    attempting to contact many people, and sorting through a myriad of websites. Our objective in 
                    providing these streamlined suggestions is simple: to help you become a fully informed voter 
                    without going through the same time-consuming, often frustrating process we did. The steps 
                    listed below are designed to maximize your productivity and minimize wasted effort.

                            <strong>Study the Candidates:</strong> The most straightforward way to understand who's running and what 
                            they stand for is by checking out our consolidated Candidates page. To our knowledge, this is the most 
                            efficient means to learn about the candidates. Also, be sure to pro-actively follow the candidates on 
                            social media to stay up to date. And by pro-actively I mean set aside time once every few weeks to check
                            their pages, because simply clicking the follow buttons may lead to posts getting lost in the clutter, or
                            even missing shadow-banned posts.

                            <strong>Internalize the Popular Issues:</strong> Before you can assess a candidate's suitability, you need 
                            to know where you stand on the key issues. Our Issues page offers a comprehensive overview of ongoing and 
                            popular issues at the county and state level. This will help you prepare questions for the candidates and 
                            understand what matters most to you.
