                    Navigating the labyrinth of local politics can be a daunting task. The process of gathering 
                    all the information on this site involved many hours of research, attending numerous events,

                    providing these streamlined suggestions is simple: to help you become a fully informed voter 
                    without going through the same time-consuming, often frustrating process we did. The steps 
                    listed below are designed to maximize your productivity and minimize wasted effort.

                                    <strong>Bi-weekly Republican Party Breakfast at Eastlyn Golf Course:</strong> This suggestion isn't meant to be partisan; it's based on the frequency and consistency of these events. At these Saturday morning gatherings, you can meet Republican candidates and ask them election-related questions. There's currently no comparable event for Democrats, as they haven't posted any events on their website in quite some time. <a href="https://informthevotecc.netlify.app/child_pages/events">See our Events page for more info.</a> <a href="https://www.ccrrogop.org/event-calendar">More info also on CCROGOP Website.</a>
