                    Navigating the labyrinth of local politics can be a daunting task. The process of gathering 
                    all the information on this site involved many hours of research, attending numerous events, 
                    attempting to contact many people, and sorting through a myriad of websites. Our objective in 
                    providing these streamlined suggestions is simple: to help you become a fully informed voter 
                    without going through the same time-consuming, often frustrating process we did. The steps 
                    listed below are designed to maximize your productivity and minimize wasted effort.

                            <strong>Internalize the Popular Issues:</strong> Before you can assess a candidate's suitability, you need to know where you stand on the key issues. Our Issues page offers a comprehensive overview of ongoing and popular issues at the county and state level. This will help you prepare questions for the candidates and understand what matters most to you. <a href="/child_pages/cc-elections/cc_election_issues.html">Learn more.</a>

                                    In terms of what will most effectively inform your vote, we suggest the following events in order of relevance:
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <ul class="gi-ul">
                                <li class="gi-ul-li">
                                    <strong>Bi-weekly Republican Party Breakfast at Eastlyn Golf Course:</strong> This suggestion isn't meant to be partisan; it's based on the frequency and consistency of these events. At these Saturday morning gatherings, you can meet Republican candidates and ask them election-related questions. There's currently no comparable event for Democrats, as they haven't posted any events on their website in quite some time.
                                </li>
                                <li class="gi-ul-li">
                                    <strong>County Commissioner Meetings:</strong> These meetings are a great way to understand how local government functions and what issues are currently at the forefront. Each meeting has a 'public comments' section, allowing you to actively participate. Prepare your questions and bring a notebook to jot down important points.
                                </li>
                                <li class="gi-ul-li">
                                    <strong>Casual County Events:</strong> Events like Deerfield Day give you a chance to interact with candidates, even if the main focus isn't on the upcoming election. However, these events are often poorly advertised, which we hope to change.
                                </li>
                                <li class="gi-ul-li">
                                    <strong>Miscellaneous County Department Meetings:</strong> These meetings can offer a deeper dive into the workings of the county. While they may not directly relate to the upcoming election, they provide context for larger political issues and can be beneficial for those with extra time and curiosity.
