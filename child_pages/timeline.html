        <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="On June 2nd I received a sample primary ballot 
        in the mail. Having been increasingly interested in politics over the years, I decided to do 
        some research on the candidates before casting my vote. However, there was no direction to a 
        website or any other source of information included on the sample ballot. So I decided to do 
        some google searching and still came up empty handed. I then decided to see if I could find 
        the candidates contact information online and message them directly. After messaging all of 
        the candidates who had contact info online, only one replied indicating that they did not 
        have a website yet. So on June 2nd, I casted a blind, ignorant vote.">

        <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="Given that there would still be 5 months to 
        learn about the candidates, I decided to follow through with a deeper dive to find candidate 
        contact information. So for one week I looked for whatever emails and social media contacts 
        I could find. After writing them all, I received no repsonses. Then the next week I tried 
        all their phone numbers. No responses. Then the next week I wrote them all letters. No 
        response. Feeling as though this might be turning into a story for the local paper and also 
        feeling as though they may already be covering the election, I decided to try contacting our 
        local paper, The Daily Journal. So I drove over to their building and found it vacant. Turns
        out they have been absorbed by a parent company. So I looked online and tried contacting 
        all their email addresses and phone numbers. Also no response.">

        <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="On July 6th I wrote an email to Mayor Fanucci 
        of Vineland and he responded the same day. We spoke on the phone the next day regarding my 
        experience and he told me he would reach out to both parties regarding their need to be more 
        accessible. The Republican Party reached out to me about a week later, where I was able to 
        confirm I was able to attend a public bi-weekly breakfast, which would be my start to 
        scratching the surface of candidate information. The Democrat party never reached out to me.">

      <div class="ms-content">
        <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="Now that I had some type of direct path towards 
        actually finding candidate information, I planned to attend the bi-weekly republican 
        breakfast. At that meeting I was able to get a general stance of the overall vibe of the 
        republican party in Cumberland County, but didn't necessarily find direct candidate 
        information. I was able to speak to someone who let me know about Deerfield Day, an event 
        happening that same day where the candidates would be able to speak with me. So I went there 
        and was able to meet 4 of the 16 candidates. A few of them gave me quite a bit of info about 
        themselves, the other two not so much. Even when asking a democrat candidate where I might 
        learn how to follow their event schedule so I could learn more, they said that they just wing 
        it. When randomly discussing my experiences with a friend later that month, he suggested that 
        I start going to the commissioner meetings, where I would be able to bring up the issue and 
        learn about county issues. So I started going to these meetings and other county events, 
        slowly piecing some things together regarding local politics and the candidates. The 
        democrats and republicans eventually put some information about their candidates on their 
        party sites, but much of it was surface level.">

        <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="After spending a few months trying to simply 
        show up as a curious citizen and learn the ropes about local politics so that I could cast
        an informed vote, I really started to understand the depth of the problem and decided to be 
        more directly vocal about it. After all, our government is supposed to react to our concerns 
        and I had gotten my feet wet a bit participating in the Middle Mile Grant discussions, so 
        why not continue participating? I delivered a 5 minute speech at a commissioner's meeting 
        where I outline my experience, I identified the problem, and suggested some solutions such 
        as a candidate/election information hub on a website and legislation setting up a minimum 
        standard for candidates to make their platforms transparent. The response from the 
        commissioners was along the lines of 'we agree that there is a problem, but we can't 
        legislate it because it will turn into a slippery slope of micromanagement. They also 
        suggested writing to the state level representatives. Another few weeks went by as I 
        continued showing up to county meetings and writing the state level representatives. At the 
        next county meeting I brought the issue back up and they said they had not heard back from 
        the state level, nor did there seem to be any urgency to address the lack of transparency.">

        <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="As one would expect, once election season 
        really started getting closer, the amount of events and accessibility to the candidates 
        increased. The republican breakfasts got busier, so I was able to meet a few more candidates 
        there, and the NAACP Candidates Forum would theoretically all be there (although it's worth 
        noting that I saw no advertising for this event, a candidate texted me this information by 
        chance since they were at the commissioners meeting where I gave my initial speech). While 
        attending the candidates forum was informative, it would be more helpful to the average 
        voter, not someone who was truly following along like myself. Several very obvious questions 
        were missed, and lots of the questions/answers were still very surface level. I again 
        brought up the lack of press coverage in the county, and the candidates themselves echoed 
        similar responses that were essentially 'you're correct, there is a problem, but we might 
        not do anything about it.' Several days later there was a Democrat meet and greet, one of 
        the only opportunities I knew where Democrats would be available to speak, as their event 
        page on cumberlandnjdems.com hasn't been updated in months. I marked the day on my calendar 
        and prepared many questions, as this might be my last opportunity to find out what their 
        platforms and policy proposals were, and to ask glaringly obvious questions such as 'So did 
        Charles Laspata actually ghost the campaign? What's the story with him?' I was told I was 
        not welcome at the event pretty much as soon as I walked in.">

        <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="After spending months pro-actively searching 
        for comprehensive candidate info, I ultimately only had about half the information I really 
        needed to feel as though I was truly informed. So I made my voting decision with many 
        unanswered questions and lots of speculatively formed opinions. I truly wanted to give 
        everyone the benefit of the doubt, especially considering today's political climate. Perhaps 
        those candidates who have trouble figuring out why it is so hard getting people to get more 
        involved with politics and not only vote, but cast an informed vote... Perhaps they should 
        take a look at this 5 month timeline.">
