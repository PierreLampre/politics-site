                  Below is a list of phases and events that I experienced during this year's 5 month long election campaign. During these 
                  phases I went from a curious citizen, to a concerned citizen, to slowly learning, to voicing my concern, and finally 
                  a quasi-citizen journalist who was ultimately told by one candidate at a public meet and greet that 'you're not welcome 
                  here, you ask too many questions. You ought to have enough info by now.' So now, after months of pro-active searching, I 
                  am a partially informed voter.

          <div class="ms-content">
            <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="On June 2nd I received a sample primary ballot 
            in the mail. Having been increasingly interested in politics over the years, I decided to do 
            some research on the candidates before casting my vote. However, there was no direction to a 
            website or any other source of information included on the sample ballot. So I decided to do 
            some google searching and still came up empty handed. I then decided to see if I could find 
            the candidates contact information online and message them directly. After messaging all of 
            the candidates who had contact info online, only one replied indicating that they did not 
            have a website yet. So on June 2nd, I casted a blind, ignorant vote.">

            learn about the candidates, I decided to follow through with a deeper dive to find candidate 
            contact information. So for one week I looked for whatever emails and social media contacts 
            I could find. After writing them all, I received no repsonses. Then the next week I tried 
            all their phone numbers. No responses. Then the next week I wrote them all letters. No 
            response. Feeling as though this might be turning into a story for the local paper and also 
            feeling as though they may already be covering the election, I decided to try contacting our 
            local paper, The Daily Journal. So I drove over to their building and found it vacant. Turns
            out they have been absorbed by a parent company. So I looked online and tried contacting 
            all their email addresses and phone numbers. Also no response.">

            <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="On July 6th I wrote an email to Mayor Fanucci 
            of Vineland and he responded the same day. We spoke on the phone the next day regarding my 
            experience and he told me he would reach out to both parties regarding their need to be more 
            accessible. The Republican Party reached out to me about a week later, where I was able to 
            confirm I was able to attend a public bi-weekly breakfast, which would be my start to 
            scratching the surface of candidate information. The Democrat party never reached out to me.">

            <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="Now that I had some type of direct path towards 
            actually finding candidate information, I planned to attend the bi-weekly republican 
            breakfast. At that meeting I was able to get a general stance of the overall vibe of the 
            republican party in Cumberland County, but didn't necessarily find direct candidate 
            information. I was able to speak to someone who let me know about Deerfield Day, an event 
            happening that same day where the candidates would be able to speak with me. So I went there 
            and was able to meet 4 of the 16 candidates. A few of them gave me quite a bit of info about 
            themselves, the other two not so much. Even when asking a democrat candidate where I might 
            learn how to follow their event schedule so I could learn more, they said that they just wing 
            it. When randomly discussing my experiences with a friend later that month, he suggested that 
            I start going to the commissioner meetings, where I would be able to bring up the issue and 
            learn about county issues. So I started going to these meetings and other county events, 
            slowly piecing some things together regarding local politics and the candidates. The 
            democrats and republicans eventually put some information about their candidates on their 
            party sites, but much of it was surface level.">

            <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="After spending a few months trying to simply 
            show up as a curious citizen and learn the ropes about local politics so that I could cast
            an informed vote, I really started to understand the depth of the problem and decided to be 
            more directly vocal about it. After all, our government is supposed to react to our concerns 
            and I had gotten my feet wet a bit participating in the Middle Mile Grant discussions, so 
            why not continue participating? I delivered a 5 minute speech at a commissioner's meeting 
            where I outline my experience, I identified the problem, and suggested some solutions such 
            as a candidate/election information hub on a website and legislation setting up a minimum 
            standard for candidates to make their platforms transparent. The response from the 
            commissioners was along the lines of 'we agree that there is a problem, but we can't 
            legislate it because it will turn into a slippery slope of micromanagement. They also 
            suggested writing to the state level representatives. Another few weeks went by as I 
            continued showing up to county meetings and writing the state level representatives. At the 
            next county meeting I brought the issue back up and they said they had not heard back from 
            the state level, nor did there seem to be any urgency to address the lack of transparency.">

            <div class="timeline-event" data-event-info="As one would expect, once election season 
            really started getting closer, the amount of events and accessibility to the candidates 
            increased. The republican breakfasts got busier, so I was able to meet a few more candidates 
            there, and the NAACP Candidates Forum would theoretically all be there (although it's worth 
            noting that I saw no advertising for this event, a candidate texted me this information by 
            chance since they were at the commissioners meeting where I gave my initial speech). While 
            attending the candidates forum was informative, it would be more helpful to the average 
            voter, not someone who was truly following along like myself. Several very obvious questions 
            were missed, and lots of the questions/answers were still very surface level. I again 
            brought up the lack of press coverage in the county, and the candidates themselves echoed 
            similar responses that were essentially 'you're correct, there is a problem, but we might 
            not do anything about it.' Several days later there was a Democrat meet and greet, one of 
            the only opportunities I knew where Democrats would be available to speak, as their event 
            page on cumberlandnjdems.com hasn't been updated in months. I marked the day on my calendar 
            and prepared many questions, as this might be my last opportunity to find out what their 
            platforms and policy proposals were, and to ask glaringly obvious questions such as 'So did 
            Charles Laspata actually ghost the campaign? What's the story with him?' I was told I was 
            not welcome at the event pretty much as soon as I walked in.">

            unanswered questions and lots of speculatively formed opinions. I truly wanted to give 
            everyone the benefit of the doubt, especially considering today's political climate. Perhaps 
            those candidates who have trouble figuring out why it is so hard getting people to get more 
            involved with politics and not only vote, but cast an informed vote... Perhaps they should 
            take a look at this 5 month timeline.">
