          <h6 class="page-title">County Commissioner</h6>
          <p>This year 2 seats are open on the County Commissioner board. The republicans are running two incumbents, <a href="https://www.ccrrogop.org/county-commissioner">Director Commissioner Sileo and Commissioner Romero</a>. 
            The democrats are running two challengers, <a href="https://cumberlandnjdems.com/elections/our-democratic-candidates/">former Commissioner Capizola and former Sheriff Austino</a>. 
            Both parties appear to be running 'slate', which means they are running as a team within their parties, potentially all the way up to the national level (in fact, the 
            democrat candidates have officially endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket on their facebook). All candidates have been reached out to in terms of clarifying their individual 
            characteristics, agendas, policy positions, and comparisons to other candidates. While some candidates have posted some information and spoken to us at various events, only 
            former Sheriff Austino has directly responded to those detailed requests. He gave a brief explanation regarding the current board potentially spending too much money on 
            County Park projects, to which one of his opponents, current Commissioner Romero, responded that the projects are within budget and there is no need for concern.
            <br>
            <br>
            The two republican incumbents for County Commissioner inherently have experience, generally promote conservative values and policy, and have addressed local issues from a 
            conservative perspective. For example, they voted no for the Middle Mile Broadband project for fiscally conservative reasons and they have brought up concerns on how 
            national immigration policy is affecting our county (apparently MS-13 gang members have been identified here in Cumberland County - Commissioner Sileo stated at a recent 
            Republican breakfast meeting). 
            It is also common messaging from the local Republicans that the Democrats have been predominantly in charge for the past 40 odd years and have made a mess during that time,
            In that vein, some recent articles suggest some of our cities are the worst in the state, so maybe it is time for the County to give Republicans a chance peel back the 
            layers of a messy onion currently present in county government, and once the mess is identified, it will take time to clean up. With that in mind, it is the opinion of 
            InformTheVote that the Democrat challengers ought to present more information on why a change in the current Republican dominated leadership might be beneficial.
            With such little information regarding how local candidates might handle local issues, it remains difficult to know what the actual choices are, and it 
            could be fair to say that the incumbents are doing a good job... if it ain't broke, don't fix it. On the other hand, since no clear, public differentiations have been made 
            regarding the candidates from their challengers or their own parties, with some candidates openly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamrileyaustinocapizola/posts/pfbid02TfP87cUqFVnRcghD2B2azdWREc7QMw6twNeWtgZYQ1obVZwmXvrB2McQgDrfFEHxl?rdid=kpuRhdj1uAT0qrfm">endorsing their national ticket</a>,
            if you more generally agree with Democrat or Republican party platforms, voting party-line is understandable. Be sure to check out the  
            <a href="https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf">Republican Party Platform</a> and 
            <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/platform">Agenda 47</a> (Donald Trump's agenda) to see the general direction of Republicans. Also be sure to check out the
            <a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/">Democrat Party Platform</a> and the Harris-Walz ticket 
            <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/">Campaign Site</a>). It should be noted that the DNC and Harris did not officially post their platform and stances on issues up 
            until mid to late September, leaving voters little to no time to look it over before early/mail-in voting.

        <h4 class="sub-heading-ballot">What does a commissioner do?</h4>
        <div class="job-description can-sec">

            A county commissioner is an elected official responsible for overseeing the administration of county government, like an extension of the state government that oversees the 
            specific county. The role can vary slightly depending on the specific laws and regulations of the state, but generally, county commissioners have the following responsibilities:
            <br>
            <br>

            <details>
                <summary style="cursor:pointer; color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">Learn More</summary>
                Budgeting and Finance: County commissioners are responsible for creating and approving the county's budget. They allocate funds to various departments and services, such as 
                law enforcement, public health, infrastructure, and education.
                <br>
                <br>
                Policy Making: They set policies for the county, including zoning laws, land use planning, and local ordinances. Commissioners may also pass resolutions that impact 
                county operations and the well-being of residents.
                <br>
                <br>
                Infrastructure and Public Works: Commissioners oversee the maintenance and development of county infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, parks, and public buildings. 
                They may also be involved in decisions regarding public transportation and utilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Public Safety and Health: They ensure that services like law enforcement, fire protection, emergency medical services, and public health departments are adequately funded 
                and managed.
                <br>
                <br>
                Taxation: County commissioners have the authority to levy taxes and determine the tax rate for the county. They ensure that sufficient revenue is generated to fund county 
                services.
                <br>
                <br>
                Community Services: They oversee various community services, including social services, libraries, and recreation programs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Economic Development: Commissioners often work on initiatives to promote economic growth in the county, including attracting businesses, supporting local agriculture, and 
                fostering job creation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Representation: County commissioners serve as representatives of the residents in their district or the county at large, depending on how the commission is structured. 
                They listen to constituents' concerns and advocate for their needs at the county level.
                <br>
                <br>
                Environmental and Land Use Issues: Commissioners may be involved in decisions related to environmental protection, land conservation, and the regulation of natural resources.
                <br>
                <br>
                Collaboration with Other Governments: County commissioners often work with state and local governments, as well as regional authorities, to coordinate services and address 
                issues that cross jurisdictional boundaries.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, county commissioners play a crucial role in shaping the policies and services that affect the daily lives of county residents.
