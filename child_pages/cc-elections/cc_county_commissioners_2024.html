          The general election ballot is now set: Republican incumbents Victoria Lods and Douglas Albrecht will face Democratic challengers John Capizola and Yolanda Garcia 
          Balicki.
        <br>
          <br>
          This race is notable for both what has changed and what hasn’t. On one hand, Republicans have, over the past few years, been more consistently transparent and 
          accessible—attending public events and offering opportunities for voters to hear from them directly. On the other hand, with the recent decision to make the 
          bi-weekly Republican breakfasts Republicans-only, that relative advantage in openness will almost certainly shrink.
         <br>
          <br>
         For voters, this means we are heading into another election season where getting clear, reliable, and timely information may once again feel like a scavenger hunt. 
         Part of why this project exists is because there is no centralized, official way to access *comprehensive* candidate and issues-based information when your sample 
         ballot arrives. What should be a simple afternoon of reviewing 3rd party vetted platforms too often turns into weeks, months, or years of emails, phone calls, and tracking 
         down events.
        <br>
          <br>
         Right now, Capizola and Balicki have a low transparency and accessibility rating—but that is easily fixable. Filling out a candidate questionnaire takes an hour or two. 
         Participating in a radio interview takes another hour. Recording a longer podcast later in the season might take a few more. In other words, with an afternoon’s effort, 
         they could make sure every Cumberland County voter has free, well-promoted access to their positions before November.
        <br>
          <br>
        At the same time, while Lods and Albrecht are ahead of the curve thanks to past engagement, there are still four months to go, and anything can happen—politically or 
        practically. Issues evolve, priorities shift, and if there is no longer an open-door forum for updates, we risk ending up exactly where we started two years ago: 
        having to invest full-time hours just to be reasonably informed.
        <br>
          <br>
        If that is genuinely the baseline expectation for civic engagement in 2025—that citizens must piece everything together themselves—we have to ask serious questions 
        about whether that’s a fair or sustainable system.
        <br>
          <br>
        In short, this race is wide open in terms of how transparent and responsive it could become. I’ll be watching closely—and doing my best to make sure the voters of 
        Cumberland County don’t have to do all the work alone.

                A county commissioner is an elected official responsible for overseeing the administration of county government, like an extension of the state government that oversees the 
                specific county. The role can vary slightly depending on the specific laws and regulations of the state, but generally, county commissioners have the following responsibilities:
                <br>
                <br>
                Budgeting and Finance: County commissioners are responsible for creating and approving the county's budget. They allocate funds to various departments and services, such as 
                law enforcement, public health, infrastructure, and education.
                <br>
                <br>
                Policy Making: They set policies for the county, including zoning laws, land use planning, and local ordinances. Commissioners may also pass resolutions that impact 
                county operations and the well-being of residents.
                <br>
                <br>
                Infrastructure and Public Works: Commissioners oversee the maintenance and development of county infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, parks, and public buildings. 
                They may also be involved in decisions regarding public transportation and utilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Public Safety and Health: They ensure that services like law enforcement, fire protection, emergency medical services, and public health departments are adequately funded 
                and managed.
                <br>
                <br>
                Taxation: County commissioners have the authority to levy taxes and determine the tax rate for the county. They ensure that sufficient revenue is generated to fund county 
                services.
                <br>
                <br>
                Community Services: They oversee various community services, including social services, libraries, and recreation programs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Economic Development: Commissioners often work on initiatives to promote economic growth in the county, including attracting businesses, supporting local agriculture, and 
                fostering job creation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Representation: County commissioners serve as representatives of the residents in their district or the county at large, depending on how the commission is structured. 
                They listen to constituents' concerns and advocate for their needs at the county level.
                <br>
                <br>
                Environmental and Land Use Issues: Commissioners may be involved in decisions related to environmental protection, land conservation, and the regulation of natural resources.
                <br>
                <br>
                Collaboration with Other Governments: County commissioners often work with state and local governments, as well as regional authorities, to coordinate services and address 
                issues that cross jurisdictional boundaries.

                <p>
                    Mail-in ballots are already out, and voters are heading into the fall season with a clearer sense of how the two tickets are 
                    approaching transparency. Republican incumbents Victoria Lods and Douglas Albrecht will face Democratic challengers John Capizola and 
                    Yolanda Garcia Balicki in November.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the summer, both the dynamics and the information gaps have become sharper. Commissioner Albrecht has now completed a 
                    second substantive interview with me on his radio show and even joined a “man on the street” segment at the Vineland Food 
                    Truck Festival. Commissioner Lods is scheduled to appear on my radio show on September 30. These are not one-off appearances 
                    but sit on top of two years of openness—allowing me to attend the bi-weekly Republican breakfasts, granting repeated access, 
                    and providing voters multiple touchpoints, despite that access having changed recently.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By contrast, Capizola and Garcia-Balicki have so far remained hesitant to engage with this platform. Apart from surface-level 
                    biographical blurbs on the CCRDO website, there is still no centralized or substantive agenda/issue content available to 
                    voters. Behind the scenes, I’ve encountered repeated uncertainty about who their campaign managers are and whether county 
                    Democrats might offer their own open forum (akin to the Republican breakfast). One local source even remarked something to the 
                    effect of, “You couldn’t 
                    pay people to go to such a Democrat meeting,” underscoring how few opportunities have been created for public exchange.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I’m not trying to “beat up” on county-level Democrats; the question I’ve been asking for two years is still unanswered: 
                    “What substantive argument is anyone making for county-level Democrats—even if you’re not thrilled with current Republican 
                    leadership?” One might think that would be a top priority when just a few years ago their State Senatorial candidate "ghosted the 
                    campaign", as per the Atlantic City Press. Until voters are given a clear, well-promoted picture of each side’s priorities, the 
                    risk remains that ordinary 
                    citizens will have to do detective work just to cast an informed ballot, at least for one side of the aisle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In short, this race is somewhat still open—not only in terms of policy but also in terms of transparency and responsiveness. 
                    The incumbents have banked some goodwill with repeated appearances, but they’re not finished yet; and the challengers could 
                    still close the information gap quickly if they choose, I'm just not holding my breath that they will. I’ll keep tracking 
                    developments as a citizen journalist so that Cumberland County voters 
                    don’t have to piece it all together on their own.

                        <p style="margin-top:10px; text-align: center;">
                            Cumberland County recently completed its most significant library renovation in over four decades, transforming the 
                            main facility into a multi-purpose resource center with expanded technology, family-friendly programming, and safer 
                            children’s areas. Hundreds of events are now hosted each year, from GED prep and computer literacy to yoga and 
                            cultural activities. Plans are also underway for an accessible playground with literacy-themed story panels in 
                            front of the library. However, a proposed grant-funded satellite library and visitor center in Maurice River 
                            Township—intended to serve outlying communities with few public resources—lost its funding early. The question 
                            for voters is how to maintain momentum on literacy initiatives, ensure equitable access for rural residents, and 
                            support libraries as hubs for education, workforce development, and civic engagement.

                            Cumberland County has consistently ranked at or near last place in New Jersey for health outcomes. While there has been 
                            a slight improvement in rankings, structural challenges remain. County officials link public health to fiscal and 
                            staffing reforms, such as finalizing union contracts, retaining experienced employees, and improving conditions at 
                            the county jail. Inter-municipal cooperation—like the Sheriff’s Office lending assistance to local police—has also 
                            been cited as a factor in community resilience. Voters may consider how best to direct resources to improve public 
                            health and safety while ensuring stable and effective delivery of county services.

                            The county’s low household income rankings reflect deeper issues such as slow project management, outdated systems, 
                            and missed economic opportunities. Modernizing county operations, completing capital improvements, and retaining 
                            institutional knowledge are seen as prerequisites to attracting and keeping businesses and residents. Recent efforts 
                            have included settling multiple union contracts, leveraging federal and state funding for infrastructure projects 
                            like the Middle Mile broadband backbone, and lowering the county tax rate by five cents. The broader question is how 
                            to sustain these gains and strengthen the foundational services that make economic development possible.

                            Many of Cumberland County’s challenges—low income, poor health rankings, and sluggish infrastructure progress—are tied 
                            to inefficiencies within local government. Examples include delayed capital projects, unresolved labor contracts, 
                            and outdated systems. Addressing these issues has involved finalizing contracts, improving staff retention, and 
                            promoting inter-agency cooperation, such as sharing fire equipment between municipalities. Voters may weigh the 
                            importance of internal capacity-building, reduced bureaucratic drag, and better coordination between departments 
                            and municipalities as a path to restoring public trust and delivering results.

                            The long-delayed rebuild of the South Avenue culvert in Bridgeton has become a symbol of broader infrastructure and 
                            permitting problems. Despite funding, planning, and contractor coordination being complete, the project remains stuck 
                            due to state and federal red tape, including seven separate permits from multiple agencies. This case highlights the 
                            tension between local readiness and higher-level regulatory bottlenecks, raising questions about how to streamline 
                            processes and ensure timely completion of critical infrastructure.

                            The Middle Mile project was designed to install a high-capacity fiber-optic backbone across Cumberland and Salem 
                            Counties, enabling local providers to bring last-mile internet to underserved rural areas. Salem County has now taken 
                            the lead, securing over $20 million in federal funding. Supporters argue the project could modernize broadband access, 
                            attract data centers and remote work opportunities, and generate revenue through leasing fiber lines. The key issue is 
                            whether and how Cumberland County can still capitalize on this opportunity to close the digital divide and spur 
                            economic development.

                        <p style="margin-top:10px; text-align: center;">
                            Cumberland County is transitioning from a troubled local jail system toward a regional partnership with Camden County 
                            after a failed joint facility project with Salem and Gloucester. The short-term plan would reduce transport and overtime costs, 
                            while the long-term vision involves a multi-county complex where Cumberland would share decision-making and staffing roles. 
                            Questions remain about how to handle the existing $16 million concrete slab from the abandoned project, the $60 million in bonded 
                            funds, and ongoing maintenance needs at the current jail. Voters may consider how to balance cost savings, workforce conditions, 
                            and public safety in this shift. There is also concern regarding the new jail project being controlled by an unelected entity which 
                            would be making direct decisions on how county tax dollars are being used.

                            The Nabb Avenue Extension project aims to create a direct connection between Route 55 and Route 49, unlocking access to the 
                            Millville Airport, industrial sites, farmland, and recreational areas on the western side of the Maurice River. Negotiated without 
                            eminent domain, the route includes erosion control measures and an overpass to maintain farm access. One could describe it as a 
                            “cornucopia of economic potential,” citing increased property values, job growth, and business expansion. While engineering and 
                            planning are complete, the project is stalled due to the loss of federal earmarks. The issue now is how to secure funding and 
                            move the project forward.

                            Expanding access to mental health and addiction services—particularly for students—is a recurring concern in Cumberland County. 
                            Many programs already exist, but awareness and access remain uneven. Local leaders have highlighted partnerships with recovery 
                            organizations and the importance of recognizing community members who champion treatment access. The challenge is how to coordinate 
                            these efforts, secure sustainable funding, and reach those who need services most. Our correspondence with the county prosecutor 
                            emphasizes that while progress is being made, there is much more to do and should be a topic of discussion this election season.

                            There is growing interest in increasing civic participation, especially among youth. Some officials stress that public servants 
                            should remain visible and connected to residents, while encouraging community members to take part in political discussions and 
                            campaigns. The broader issue is how to foster a culture of engagement so that residents feel empowered to influence decisions 
                            and hold leaders accountable. The challenge has additional concerns with the recent tragedy surrounding Charlie Kirk.
