          The general election ballot is now set: Republican incumbents Victoria Lods and Douglas Albrecht will face Democratic challengers John Capizola and Yolanda Garcia 
          Balicki.
        <br>
          <br>
          This race is notable for both what has changed and what hasn’t. On one hand, Republicans have, over the past few years, been more consistently transparent and 
          accessible—attending public events and offering opportunities for voters to hear from them directly. On the other hand, with the recent decision to make the 
          bi-weekly Republican breakfasts Republicans-only, that relative advantage in openness will almost certainly shrink.
         <br>
          <br>
         For voters, this means we are heading into another election season where getting clear, reliable, and timely information may once again feel like a scavenger hunt. 
         Part of why this project exists is because there is no centralized, official way to access *comprehensive* candidate and issues-based information when your sample 
         ballot arrives. What should be a simple afternoon of reviewing 3rd party vetted platforms too often turns into weeks, months, or years of emails, phone calls, and tracking 
         down events.
        <br>
          <br>
         Right now, Capizola and Balicki have a low transparency and accessibility rating—but that is easily fixable. Filling out a candidate questionnaire takes an hour or two. 
         Participating in a radio interview takes another hour. Recording a longer podcast later in the season might take a few more. In other words, with an afternoon’s effort, 
         they could make sure every Cumberland County voter has free, well-promoted access to their positions before November.
        <br>
          <br>
        At the same time, while Lods and Albrecht are ahead of the curve thanks to past engagement, there are still four months to go, and anything can happen—politically or 
        practically. Issues evolve, priorities shift, and if there is no longer an open-door forum for updates, we risk ending up exactly where we started two years ago: 
        having to invest full-time hours just to be reasonably informed.
        <br>
          <br>
        If that is genuinely the baseline expectation for civic engagement in 2025—that citizens must piece everything together themselves—we have to ask serious questions 
        about whether that’s a fair or sustainable system.
        <br>
          <br>
        In short, this race is wide open in terms of how transparent and responsive it could become. I’ll be watching closely—and doing my best to make sure the voters of 
        Cumberland County don’t have to do all the work alone.

                A county commissioner is an elected official responsible for overseeing the administration of county government, like an extension of the state government that oversees the 
                specific county. The role can vary slightly depending on the specific laws and regulations of the state, but generally, county commissioners have the following responsibilities:
                <br>
                <br>
                Budgeting and Finance: County commissioners are responsible for creating and approving the county's budget. They allocate funds to various departments and services, such as 
                law enforcement, public health, infrastructure, and education.
                <br>
                <br>
                Policy Making: They set policies for the county, including zoning laws, land use planning, and local ordinances. Commissioners may also pass resolutions that impact 
                county operations and the well-being of residents.
                <br>
                <br>
                Infrastructure and Public Works: Commissioners oversee the maintenance and development of county infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, parks, and public buildings. 
                They may also be involved in decisions regarding public transportation and utilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Public Safety and Health: They ensure that services like law enforcement, fire protection, emergency medical services, and public health departments are adequately funded 
                and managed.
                <br>
                <br>
                Taxation: County commissioners have the authority to levy taxes and determine the tax rate for the county. They ensure that sufficient revenue is generated to fund county 
                services.
                <br>
                <br>
                Community Services: They oversee various community services, including social services, libraries, and recreation programs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Economic Development: Commissioners often work on initiatives to promote economic growth in the county, including attracting businesses, supporting local agriculture, and 
                fostering job creation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Representation: County commissioners serve as representatives of the residents in their district or the county at large, depending on how the commission is structured. 
                They listen to constituents' concerns and advocate for their needs at the county level.
                <br>
                <br>
                Environmental and Land Use Issues: Commissioners may be involved in decisions related to environmental protection, land conservation, and the regulation of natural resources.
                <br>
                <br>
                Collaboration with Other Governments: County commissioners often work with state and local governments, as well as regional authorities, to coordinate services and address 
                issues that cross jurisdictional boundaries.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, county commissioners play a crucial role in shaping the policies and services that affect the daily lives of county residents.

                    The general election ballot is now set: Republican incumbents Victoria Lods and Douglas Albrecht will face Democratic challengers John Capizola and Yolanda Garcia 
                    Balicki.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This race is notable for both what has changed and what hasn’t. On one hand, Republicans have, over the past few years, been more consistently transparent and 
                    accessible—attending public events and offering opportunities for voters to hear from them directly. On the other hand, with the recent decision to make the 
                    bi-weekly Republican breakfasts Republicans-only, that relative advantage in openness will almost certainly shrink.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For voters, this means we are heading into another election season where getting clear, reliable, and timely information may once again feel like a scavenger hunt. 
                    Part of why this project exists is because there is no centralized, official way to access *comprehensive* candidate and issues-based information when your sample 
                    ballot arrives. What should be a simple afternoon of reviewing 3rd party vetted platforms too often turns into weeks, months, or years of emails, phone calls, and tracking 
                    down events.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Right now, Capizola and Balicki have a low transparency and accessibility rating—but that is easily fixable. Filling out a candidate questionnaire takes an hour or two. 
                    Participating in a radio interview takes another hour. Recording a longer podcast later in the season might take a few more. In other words, with an afternoon’s effort, 
                    they could make sure every Cumberland County voter has free, well-promoted access to their positions before November.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the same time, while Lods and Albrecht are ahead of the curve thanks to past engagement, there are still four months to go, and anything can happen—politically or 
                    practically. Issues evolve, priorities shift, and if there is no longer an open-door forum for updates, we risk ending up exactly where we started two years ago: 
                    having to invest full-time hours just to be reasonably informed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If that is genuinely the baseline expectation for civic engagement in 2025—that citizens must piece everything together themselves—we have to ask serious questions 
                    about whether that’s a fair or sustainable system.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In short, this race is wide open in terms of how transparent and responsive it could become. I’ll be watching closely—and doing my best to make sure the voters of 
                    Cumberland County don’t have to do all the work alone.

                            With the shutting down of newspapers all across the country, information regarding elections is scattered all over the 
                            internet and oftentimes appears biased because it is coming from the candidates themselves and their parties. The local paper,
                            The Daily Journal,
                            was absorbed by a parent company and the last reporter in the county retired last year. Without a trusted
                            3rd party entity providing objective oversight regarding issues facing the county, the public is left 
                            woefully uninformed about what is going on, especially in regards to local elections where biased political
                            messaging could be running rampant. While most of the candidates agree we need press coverage, none of them
                            seem to be particularly interested engaging in an action plan to fix the problem for a variety of reasons.
                            One candidate said "With the lack of press coverage, candidates are left to be their own press on social media." 
                            While we appreciate the pro-active approach to do something to get information out to the public, this approach could easily lead 
                            to the appearance of overwhelming bias and scattered sources of information... who has the time to
                            scour all the candidates social media pages, verify the facts, send follow-up questions that oftentimes go unanswered, attend 
                            various events that have entrance fees, etc etc etc? The press, that's who. Another candidate said "If I get involved in forming 
                            the  local press, it could be viewed as a bias for my party." Understandable, but we are still ultimately left uninformed. The 
                            public needs reasonable access to comprehensive, consolidated information regarding election choices. "We'll let the public know 
                            what we want them to know", this did not come from a candidate, but rather from a campaign organizer. It's pretty clear that we 
                            have a problem, but not necessarily anyone willing to solve it.
