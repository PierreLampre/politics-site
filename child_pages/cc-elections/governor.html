          <p>
            
            The governor's race this year is highly anticipated and has lots of competitors. To be clear, we should not be any sort of authoritative source on this race.  
            Rather, we are going to consolidate and present the info as best as we can, but ultimately it will be up to you to sift through all the information.

            <br><br>

            Phil Murphy is not seeking re-election, and the Democrats have 6 people in their primary race. Generally speaking, Steve Sweeney is the most establishment-oriented guy 
            with direct experience in state government, Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill are both moderate congresspeople, Sean Spiller is a bit of an activist teacher with 
            experience as head of the NJEA, and Steve Fulop and Ras Baraka are current mayors who are more of the aggressive reformer types.

            <br><br>

            Similarly, the Republicans have 5 candidates running in their primary. Jack Ciattarelli and Jon Bramnick are the most experienced, with Bramnick having the longest 
            legislative track record and Ciattarelli being a former Assemblyman and 2021 GOP nominee. Bill Spadea is positioning himself as the conservative outsider, leveraging 
            his radio show background to rally grassroots support. Mario Kranjac is a former mayor who openly brands himself as a “forever Trumper,” and Justin Barbera is a 
            contractor and grassroots candidate focused on amplifying everyday voters.

            The 2025 race for Governor has officially taken shape, with Jack Ciattarelli winning the Republican primary and Mikie Sherrill emerging as the 
            Democratic nominee.
            <br><br>
            To be clear, I’m not a state-level political expert, nor do I pretend to be an authoritative source on New Jersey politics as a whole. My focus 
            has always been Cumberland County—where voters often feel like an afterthought to campaigns centered on the big cities and wealthier suburbs... 
            and my platform helps to fill the gap with the collapse of local press.
            <br><br>
            That’s why, in the months leading up to November, I’ll be watching this race through a simple lens: Will these candidates show up here? Will 
            they demonstrate any real understanding of the challenges facing Cumberland County? And, if they do, will they offer any concrete ideas to 
            address them?
            <br><br>

            <details> <summary style="text-align:center; cursor:pointer; color:blue; text-decoration:underline;"> The Precursor: Where We Stand Heading Into the General Election </summary>
            The Governor’s Race: Is Cumberland County Even On Their Radar?
            <br><br>
            With the primaries over, voters statewide are narrowing their focus—but here in Cumberland County, the same old question persists: Do these 
            candidates even see us?
            <br><br>
            Over the past two years, I’ve built InformTheVoteNJ.com to spotlight local elections and shine a light on how disconnected our region often 
            feels from state politics. As I’ve documented, many of the candidates who sought the nomination rarely ventured south of Camden County—and some 
            never responded to outreach at all.
            <br><br>
            Jack Ciattarelli has been one of the few exceptions. Over the past year, he’s attended multiple Republican events in and near Cumberland County, 
            built visible ties with State Senator Mike Testa, and taken questions on issues like civics education and the collapse of local media. While he 
            has not offered detailed plans for Cumberland County specifically, the infrastructure to hear and respond seems to be in place.
            Verdict: Connected and visible, but specifics still need to materialize.
            <br><br>
            Mikie Sherrill, by contrast, has yet to demonstrate much engagement in this part of the state. In my tracking of events, appearances, and direct 
            outreach, I haven’t seen evidence that she has prioritized Cumberland County or spoken directly to its economic and infrastructure challenges. 
            As the general election unfolds, I’ll be watching closely to see whether that changes—or whether our region remains out of sight and out of mind.
            Verdict: No visible engagement so far—time will tell if she shows up.
            <br><br>
            Where does that leave us?
            Cumberland County’s concerns—like underfunded schools, fragile infrastructure, and the hollowing out of local press—deserve more than passing 
            mentions. If you’re a voter here, I’d encourage you to ask: Does this candidate even know what’s happening where I live? And if so, do they care 
            enough to do something about it?
            <br><br>
            As always, I’m not claiming to have all the answers. I’m here to consolidate information, document who shows up, and look for any substance 
            beneath the slogans. I’ll publish a deeper report on both campaigns soon. Until then, you can review interviews, event listings, and outreach 
            records at InformTheVoteNJ.com.

        General Description: The Governor of New Jersey is the head of the executive branch of the state government. As the state’s top elected official, the Governor plays a crucial role in 
        setting policy direction, overseeing state departments, managing the budget, and implementing laws passed by the legislature. The Governor represents all New Jersey residents 
        and holds significant influence over both daily governance and long-term planning.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Executive Leadership:</strong><br>
        The Governor oversees the operation of all executive agencies and departments in the state, including those responsible for health, education, transportation, law enforcement, 
        and social services. The Governor appoints department heads and sets administrative priorities to guide how laws are carried out across New Jersey.
        <br><br>

        <strong>State Budget Authority:</strong><br>
        The Governor is responsible for proposing the annual state budget, which outlines how taxpayer dollars will be spent. This includes funding for public schools, infrastructure 
        projects, public safety, healthcare, and local aid. The legislature must approve the budget, but the Governor’s proposal serves as the starting point and primary vision.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Bill Signing and Veto Power:</strong><br>
        Once the legislature passes a bill, the Governor can either sign it into law or veto it. The Governor also has the ability to issue a conditional veto—returning a bill to 
        the legislature with recommended changes. This power makes the Governor a key player in shaping legislation.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Emergency Management and Crisis Response:</strong><br>
        In times of natural disaster, public health emergencies, or civil unrest, the Governor has broad powers to declare states of emergency, mobilize resources, and issue 
        executive orders that affect residents statewide.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Appointments and Judicial Influence:</strong><br>
        The Governor appoints judges—including justices to the New Jersey Supreme Court (with Senate approval)—as well as members of boards, commissions, and various 
        regulatory agencies. These appointments shape how laws are interpreted and enforced for years to come.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Public Advocacy and Agenda Setting:</strong><br>
        Through speeches, executive orders, and policy proposals, the Governor sets the policy agenda and works to persuade the public and legislature to support major initiatives.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Statewide Representation:</strong><br>
        The Governor represents New Jersey in dealings with other states and the federal government, and acts as the face of the state during major events and emergencies.
