          <p>
            
            The governor's race this year is highly anticipated and has lots of competitors. To be clear, we should not be any sort of authoritative source on this race.  
            Rather, we are going to consolidate and present the info as best as we can, but ultimately it will be up to you to sift through all the information.

            <br><br>

            Phil Murphy is not seeking re-election, and the Democrats have 6 people in their primary race. Generally speaking, Steve Sweeney is the most establishment-oriented guy 
            with direct experience in state government, Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill are both moderate congresspeople, Sean Spiller is a bit of an activist teacher with 
            experience as head of the NJEA, and Steve Fulop and Ras Baraka are current mayors who are more of the aggressive reformer types.

            <br><br>

            Similarly, the Republicans have 5 candidates running in their primary. Jack Ciattarelli and Jon Bramnick are the most experienced, with Bramnick having the longest 
            legislative track record and Ciattarelli being a former Assemblyman and 2021 GOP nominee. Bill Spadea is positioning himself as the conservative outsider, leveraging 
            his radio show background to rally grassroots support. Mario Kranjac is a former mayor who openly brands himself as a “forever Trumper,” and Justin Barbera is a 
            contractor and grassroots candidate focused on amplifying everyday voters.

            The governor's race this year is highly anticipated and has lots of competitors. To be clear, we should not be any sort of authoritative source on this race.  
            Rather, we are going to consolidate and present the info as best as we can... and in the weeks leading up to the election date, June 10th, we are going to analyze 
            the data from the perspective of an average Cumberland County voter. In other words, we are going to look for specifics that relate to us, like "Did this candidate 
            even campaign in or near Cumberland County? Did they mention issues that directly relate to us? How would electing this specific individual help us?"

                The Governor's Race: Is Cumberland County Even On Their Radar?
                As primary season winds down, voters across New Jersey are narrowing their focus. But for those of us in Cumberland County, one question remains stubbornly unanswered: 
                Do any of these gubernatorial candidates actually care about us?
                <br>
                Over the past two years, I’ve been documenting political campaigns and transparency here in Cumberland County through InformTheVoteNJ.com. It’s been a deep dive — one 
                that started with local races but inevitably led me to this: the 2025 race for Governor. It’s a big race, with major implications for our schools, infrastructure, 
                economy, and basic visibility. And yet, it remains incredibly unclear whether the people running for the highest office in the state even know what’s happening down here.
                <br>
                So here’s my take — not from the perspective of a party operative or political insider, but from a voter who’s gone far beyond the average effort to stay informed. 
                Below is a snapshot of each gubernatorial candidate and their engagement (or lack thereof) with Cumberland County and South Jersey at large.
                <br>
                <br>
                DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
                <br>
                Steve Sweeney
                <br>
                Sweeney is technically from South Jersey — Gloucester County — which gives him a presumed familiarity with regional issues. Campaign mail has arrived at my family’s 
                home, and he’s reportedly been endorsed by the Cumberland County Democratic Party. But beyond that, there’s been no direct contact or evidence of outreach. He may have 
                mentioned Cumberland County once or twice during the Democratic debate, but nothing substantial stands out. He also did not respond to outreach from InformTheVoteNJ.
                <br>
                Verdict: Knows the region, but has not made his presence felt locally.
                <br>
                <br>
                Josh Gottheimer
                <br>
                Gottheimer has not publicly addressed Cumberland County issues to date. He is, however, scheduled to do a meet and greet in the area tomorrow, at Double Eagle Saloon in 
                Vineland — just a few weeks before the primary. While this could signal a late-game attempt to connect with voters here, it's unclear whether it’s genuine engagement or 
                performative optics. One of his staffers initially opened the door to more outreach or interviews, but ultimately failed to follow through.
                <br>
                Verdict: Possibly coming around, but far too late to demonstrate meaningful interest.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mikie Sherrill, Sean Spiller, and Ras Baraka
                <br>
                These three candidates are grouped together because they’ve demonstrated the same pattern: complete absence from the conversation in South Jersey. No events. No mentions. 
                No responses to outreach.
                <br>
                Verdict: No presence, no engagement, no apparent interest.
                <br>
                <br>
                Steve Fulop
                <br>
                To his credit, Fulop did show up in Vineland for a meet and greet at Bob Morgan Entertainment. It was a positive and pivotal moment in my own election coverage journey, 
                as his running mates Brandon Saffold and Carolyn Rush committed to an interview and participation with InformTheVoteNJ. Fulop discussed broad themes like wind energy 
                and the decline of local press. He was supportive of reintroducing civics education but didn’t offer tangible solutions for issues like infrastructure, voter outreach,
                or county-level press collapse. As a North Jersey mayor, his focus still seems tilted toward that region.
                <br>
                Verdict: Showed up and engaged — more than most — but unclear if he sees us as a priority.
                <br>
                <br>
                REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
                <br>
                <br>
                Jon Bramnick
                <br>
                There’s been no visible effort from Bramnick to engage with southern NJ, let alone Cumberland County.
                <br>
                Verdict: Absent from the region.
                <br>
                Jack Ciattarelli
                Ciattarelli has appeared multiple times at Republican events in the area over the past six months and has the endorsement of the local Republican party. He’s clearly 
                connected with State Senator Mike Testa, which could offer a pipeline for local concerns. During a town hall, I asked him about civics education and the role of counties 
                in gathering candidate information. He supported civics education but dismissed the idea of incentivizing press coverage, which felt out of step with our media reality. 
                He hasn’t explicitly addressed issues facing Cumberland County, but the infrastructure to listen and respond appears to be in place.
                <br>
                Verdict: Connected and visible, but specifics are lacking.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bill Spadea
                Spadea has held events within an hour’s drive of Cumberland County and publicly responded to a voter question about election integrity in Lawrence Township, saying he’d 
                follow up with an event. He has not followed through. While he seems aware of broader statewide issues, there’s no evidence that he’s zoomed in on what’s happening here.
                <br>
                Verdict: Some signs of interest, but no concrete action.
                <br>
                <br>
                Justin Barbera
                <br>
                Barbera has done what few others have: he showed up at a local Republican breakfast, listened, and engaged. I was able to interview him for a podcast and ask about 
                both general voter education and specific county issues like broadband infrastructure and the Nabb Avenue extension. He offered supportive and responsive answers. 
                He also plans to return to our area soon.
                <br>
                Verdict: Responsive, informed, and actively participating in local dialogue.

                Mario Kranjac
                <br>
                Kranjac initially showed interest by replying to outreach, promising to fill out a candidate questionnaire and attend a forum. But he’s been unresponsive since. 
                No events. No visibility besides brief instagram ads.
                <br>
                Verdict: Faded after initial contact — no follow-through.
                <br>
                <br>
                Conclusion: Where Does That Leave Us?
                <br>
                Cumberland County often finds itself as an afterthought in statewide elections. This report highlights just how true that still is in 2025. Of the 11 major candidates for 
                governor, only three — Fulop, Ciattarelli, and Barbera — have meaningfully interacted with our region. And even among them, only one (Barbera) has directly addressed 
                county-level issues in depth.
                <br>
                So as you consider who to vote for, ask yourself: Shouldn’t a governor be someone who sees and hears all of New Jersey — not just the big cities and wealthy suburbs?
                <br>
                For full interviews, event listings, and issue breakdowns, visit InformTheVoteNJ.com. If you’re skeptical of this summary, go down the rabbit hole yourself. All the 
                sources are there. All the outreach attempts are documented. I’m just here to say: I looked. And this is what I found. I'll do a more in-depth report in a week or so.

            Phil Murphy is not seeking re-election, and the Democrats have 6 people in their primary race. Generally speaking, Steve Sweeney is the most establishment-oriented guy 
            with direct experience in state government, Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill are both moderate congresspeople, Sean Spiller is a bit of an activist teacher with 
            experience as head of the NJEA, and Steve Fulop and Ras Baraka are current mayors who are more of the aggressive reformer types.

            <br><br>

            Similarly, the Republicans have 5 candidates running in their primary. Jack Ciattarelli and Jon Bramnick are the most experienced, with Bramnick having the longest 
            legislative track record and Ciattarelli being a former Assemblyman and 2021 GOP nominee. Bill Spadea is positioning himself as the conservative outsider, leveraging 
            his radio show background to rally grassroots support. Mario Kranjac is a former mayor who openly brands himself as a “forever Trumper,” and Justin Barbera is a 
            contractor and grassroots candidate focused on amplifying everyday voters.

    <h2 style="text-align: center">What does a Governor do?</h2>
    <br>
    <details>
        <summary style="text-align:center; cursor:pointer; color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">Learn More</summary>

        General Description: The Governor of New Jersey is the head of the executive branch of the state government. As the state’s top elected official, the Governor plays a crucial role in 
        setting policy direction, overseeing state departments, managing the budget, and implementing laws passed by the legislature. The Governor represents all New Jersey residents 
        and holds significant influence over both daily governance and long-term planning.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Executive Leadership:</strong><br>
        The Governor oversees the operation of all executive agencies and departments in the state, including those responsible for health, education, transportation, law enforcement, 
        and social services. The Governor appoints department heads and sets administrative priorities to guide how laws are carried out across New Jersey.
        <br><br>

        <strong>State Budget Authority:</strong><br>
        The Governor is responsible for proposing the annual state budget, which outlines how taxpayer dollars will be spent. This includes funding for public schools, infrastructure 
        projects, public safety, healthcare, and local aid. The legislature must approve the budget, but the Governor’s proposal serves as the starting point and primary vision.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Bill Signing and Veto Power:</strong><br>
        Once the legislature passes a bill, the Governor can either sign it into law or veto it. The Governor also has the ability to issue a conditional veto—returning a bill to 
        the legislature with recommended changes. This power makes the Governor a key player in shaping legislation.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Emergency Management and Crisis Response:</strong><br>
        In times of natural disaster, public health emergencies, or civil unrest, the Governor has broad powers to declare states of emergency, mobilize resources, and issue 
        executive orders that affect residents statewide.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Appointments and Judicial Influence:</strong><br>
        The Governor appoints judges—including justices to the New Jersey Supreme Court (with Senate approval)—as well as members of boards, commissions, and various 
        regulatory agencies. These appointments shape how laws are interpreted and enforced for years to come.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Public Advocacy and Agenda Setting:</strong><br>
        Through speeches, executive orders, and policy proposals, the Governor sets the policy agenda and works to persuade the public and legislature to support major initiatives.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Statewide Representation:</strong><br>
        The Governor represents New Jersey in dealings with other states and the federal government, and acts as the face of the state during major events and emergencies.
