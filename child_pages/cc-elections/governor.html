          <p>
            
            The governor's race this year is highly anticipated and has lots of competitors. To be clear, we should not be any sort of authoritative source on this race.  
            Rather, we are going to consolidate and present the info as best as we can, but ultimately it will be up to you to sift through all the information.

            <br><br>

            Phil Murphy is not seeking re-election, and the Democrats have 6 people in their primary race. Generally speaking, Steve Sweeney is the most establishment-oriented guy 
            with direct experience in state government, Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill are both moderate congresspeople, Sean Spiller is a bit of an activist teacher with 
            experience as head of the NJEA, and Steve Fulop and Ras Baraka are current mayors who are more of the aggressive reformer types.

            <br><br>

            Similarly, the Republicans have 5 candidates running in their primary. Jack Ciattarelli and Jon Bramnick are the most experienced, with Bramnick having the longest 
            legislative track record and Ciattarelli being a former Assemblyman and 2021 GOP nominee. Bill Spadea is positioning himself as the conservative outsider, leveraging 
            his radio show background to rally grassroots support. Mario Kranjac is a former mayor who openly brands himself as a “forever Trumper,” and Justin Barbera is a 
            contractor and grassroots candidate focused on amplifying everyday voters.

                    Note: I am not a statewide policy expert, and robust gubernatorial coverage already exists elsewhere. These pages should be thought of mainly in two ways: 
                    (1) a repository of consolidated source data voters can research themselves, and (2) a Cumberland County–specific lens on candidate engagement and visibility.

                <p>
                As of September 23, 2025, New Jersey’s gubernatorial race is fully underway. 
                We are well past the primaries that set up <strong>Jack Ciattarelli</strong> as the Republican nominee and <strong>Mikie Sherrill</strong> as 
                the Democratic nominee. 
                With mail-in ballots already being cast and the first debate having taken place last Sunday, voters who use early voting are already on a 
                ticking clock to make their decisions.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                The first step for any voter should be to review the candidates’ own source material—campaign websites, social media activity, interviews, and 
                coverage from established outlets. 
                Robust statewide reporting of this race exists. 
                However, for those who prefer a more local lens, here’s what stands out so far for Cumberland County.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                <em>Jack Ciattarelli</em> has continued making himself present in Cumberland County at public events and recently held a well-advertised 
                town hall in Pitman, which InformTheVoteNJ attended. 
                At that event he addressed a Cumberland-specific question by emphasizing the need for agricultural support, a Department of Commerce to help 
                with economic development, and state agencies that “work for the people.” 
                This ongoing visibility signals not only that he shows up but also that he is building relationships with local representatives—connections 
                that could matter if the county needs state-level help.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                By contrast, <em>Mikie Sherrill</em> has only recently begun appearing in the South Jersey landscape. 
                She made an appearance at the Green Olive 2, which appeared to be an invite-only meeting for leadership, and is reportedly holding a rally at 
                the Ramada Inn on Saturday the 27th. 
                A rally, however, typically does not leave much room for press questions, and it is expected she will deliver her statewide stump speech 
                rather than a Cumberland-specific message. 
                With ballots already going out and the first debate behind us, Ciattarelli currently shows more presence and connections in the area—at 
                least in ways visible to the public—while Sherrill’s local outreach remains light.

                    <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
                        <p>This is the first half-hour of the New Jersey gubernatorial debate between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli (approx. 2:11:00–2:46:30). The moderators pressed both candidates on affordability, taxes, energy costs, school governance, public safety, and climate. Sherrill emphasized freezing utility rate hikes via a day-one state of emergency, “dashboard/report card” transparency, and consolidations to lower costs; she repeatedly tied Ciattarelli to Trump-era policies. Ciattarelli framed New Jersey as facing crises in affordability, education, public safety, and overdevelopment; he led with tax-cut proposals (retirement income tax-free, property-tax freeze at 70, new lower income brackets) and a “rational” energy transition prioritizing nuclear, natural gas, and rooftop solar while exiting RGGI.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tone & Moderation:</strong><br>
                        Exchanges included several rebuttal rounds, with moderators occasionally granting follow-ups to clarify direct answers. The sharpest contrasts emerged on: (1) whether to make political violence a hate crime (Ciattarelli said “yes” explicitly; Sherrill focused on security, free speech, and condemnation of violence), (2) compulsory school-district consolidation (Sherrill: incentivize then consider compulsory; Ciattarelli: oppose compulsion, offer incentives), and (3) energy policy (Sherrill: freeze hikes and add generation; Ciattarelli: reopen/repurpose plants, expand nuclear/rooftop solar, leave RGGI).</p>

                        <p><strong>Affordability & Taxes:</strong><br>
                        Sherrill argued for shared services, court consolidation, and existing senior relief programs (ANCHOR/Stay NJ). Ciattarelli argued Democrats have controlled state government for decades and proposed structural tax changes, including capping first-time homebuyers’ property taxes at 1% and simplifying income tax brackets (3%/4%/5%).</p>

                        <p><strong>Schools & Governance:</strong><br>
                        On consolidation, Sherrill said New Jersey’s fragmentation raises costs and endorsed county-based systems and potential compulsory action if incentives fail. Ciattarelli stressed “home rule,” incentives only, and “back to basics” academics; he added vouchers/charters where systems are failing. A brief exchange touched on charter approvals and union influence.</p>

                        <p><strong>Public Safety & Civics Climate:</strong><br>
                        On making political violence a hate crime, Ciattarelli explicitly supported pending legislation; Sherrill centered free-speech protections, increased security for officials/families, and condemnation of violence.</p>

                <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
                    <p>This segment (approx. 2:47:00–3:15:25) covered transit, school segregation litigation, vaccination rates, taxes and pensions, and AI policy. Sherrill pointed to federal wins like Gateway and targeted rail fixes, pledged to freeze utility rate hikes, and backed county-based school systems plus phonics and high-intensity tutoring. Ciattarelli proposed consolidating transportation authorities into a single Garden State Transportation Authority with one management structure and a dedicated state-budget revenue stream; on education, he emphasized a “high-impact curriculum” triaging reading/writing/math and expanded school choice where districts underperform.</p>

                    <p><strong>Transit & Infrastructure:</strong><br>
                    Sherrill highlighted work on Gateway and funding for rail maintenance; Ciattarelli argued for a single statewide transit authority and route-by-route ridership justifications.</p>

                    <p><strong>Segregation Lawsuit & School Performance:</strong><br>
                    A panel question pressed both on the ongoing segregation lawsuit. Ciattarelli said the suit should proceed while he focuses day-one on performance via high-impact curriculum and choice in failing districts. Sherrill said county-based systems, phonics by grade 3, and tutoring are key—and that she would address segregation directly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Public Health & Vaccination:</strong><br>
                    Both called sub-herd-immunity vaccination rates concerning; Sherrill said she would align with regional governors on vaccine protocols, while Ciattarelli affirmed support for the standard schedule and broadened to a general “protect all students” framing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tax Policy & Pensions:</strong><br>
                    On sales tax, Ciattarelli said he would not raise it and instead lower income and property taxes; Sherrill declined to pre-commit, citing fiscal responsibility and a projected budget gap. On pensions, Sherrill said to end “pension holidays” and improve creditworthiness; Ciattarelli said health-plan costs are “crushing the middle class” and need urgent control while affirming pensions will be paid.</p>

                    <p><strong>AI & Tech Governance:</strong><br>
                    Ciattarelli said he’d convene experts on social manipulation and job loss, modernize legacy state systems (some still on DOS), and balance adoption with guardrails. Sherrill backed guardrails, a state version of the Kids Online Safety Act, STEM/occupational county schools, and protections against deepfakes and data abuse.</p>

                        <p>This closing segment (approx. 3:15:30–3:42:30) hit education funding amid federal changes, housing growth vs. school capacity, Medicaid reforms and disability services, public trust, DMV modernization, immigration enforcement policy, mental health infrastructure, and closing statements.</p>

                        <p><strong>Education After Federal DOE Changes:</strong><br>
                        Sherrill said she’d have the AG sue to “claw back” lost federal dollars and argued New Jersey sends more to Washington than it receives. Ciattarelli countered that funding can still flow without a federal department and refocused on a new curriculum and more vocational pathways.</p>

                        <p><strong>Housing & School Capacity:</strong><br>
                        Asked about a state bond to build schools, Ciattarelli said <em>no</em>, preferring partnerships that steer growth to urban cores and more lease-to-purchase affordable options; he criticized sprawl and farmland conversions. Sherrill stressed directing existing education money to students/educators/facilities while also preserving open space.</p>

                        <p><strong>Medicaid & Disability Services:</strong><br>
                        Ciattarelli described reforms (semiannual eligibility checks; 20 hours/week of work/education/volunteering for able-bodied adults with children ≥15) as reasonable safeguards to protect the program and vowed to prioritize the most vulnerable. Sherrill warned administrative changes would raise costs and shift patients to ER care; she framed decisions around cost-effectiveness and outcomes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Restoring Trust:</strong><br>
                        Ciattarelli said leadership starts with personal compliance with the law and vowed aggressive anti-corruption enforcement. Sherrill emphasized service (Navy pilot, prosecutor, mom) and focusing on costs and rights to rebuild confidence.</p>

                        <p><strong>DMV/MVC Modernization:</strong><br>
                        Ciattarelli promised “Executive Order #2: everyone back to work” and daily, hands-on management to fix service backlogs. Sherrill said most services should be online; in-person visits should be quick and reliable.</p>

                        <p><strong>Immigrant Trust Directive:</strong><br>
                        Sherrill emphasized following law and due-process rights; she criticized masked, unidentifiable ICE interactions. Pressed for a yes/no on keeping the directive, she reiterated law/Constitution framing. Ciattarelli said he’d rescind the directive on day one, oppose sanctuary policies, and “back the blue.”</p>

                        <p><strong>Mental Health:</strong><br>
                        Ciattarelli proposed county-level 24/7 community mental-health centers statewide (and shelters), citing a Somerset County model, and later urged moving to Medicare-level reimbursement to expand access. Sherrill supported funding wraparound services, red-flag laws, and programs pairing police with clinicians, plus adding housing support.</p>

                        <p><strong>Closings:</strong><br>
                        Sherrill: lifelong service, freeze costs, protect rights, contrast with Ciattarelli on taxes and federal alignment. Ciattarelli: NJ roots, business/CPA background, tax and service reforms, and a pledge that governor is his “final destination,” not a stepping stone.</p>

                General Description: The Governor of New Jersey is the head of the executive branch of the state government. As the state’s top elected official, the Governor plays a crucial role in 
                setting policy direction, overseeing state departments, managing the budget, and implementing laws passed by the legislature. The Governor represents all New Jersey residents 
                and holds significant influence over both daily governance and long-term planning.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Executive Leadership:</strong><br>
                The Governor oversees the operation of all executive agencies and departments in the state, including those responsible for health, education, transportation, law enforcement, 
                and social services. The Governor appoints department heads and sets administrative priorities to guide how laws are carried out across New Jersey.
                <br><br>

                <strong>State Budget Authority:</strong><br>
                The Governor is responsible for proposing the annual state budget, which outlines how taxpayer dollars will be spent. This includes funding for public schools, infrastructure 
                projects, public safety, healthcare, and local aid. The legislature must approve the budget, but the Governor’s proposal serves as the starting point and primary vision.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Bill Signing and Veto Power:</strong><br>
                Once the legislature passes a bill, the Governor can either sign it into law or veto it. The Governor also has the ability to issue a conditional veto—returning a bill to 
                the legislature with recommended changes. This power makes the Governor a key player in shaping legislation.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Emergency Management and Crisis Response:</strong><br>
                In times of natural disaster, public health emergencies, or civil unrest, the Governor has broad powers to declare states of emergency, mobilize resources, and issue 
                executive orders that affect residents statewide.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Appointments and Judicial Influence:</strong><br>
                The Governor appoints judges—including justices to the New Jersey Supreme Court (with Senate approval)—as well as members of boards, commissions, and various 
                regulatory agencies. These appointments shape how laws are interpreted and enforced for years to come.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Public Advocacy and Agenda Setting:</strong><br>
                Through speeches, executive orders, and policy proposals, the Governor sets the policy agenda and works to persuade the public and legislature to support major initiatives.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Statewide Representation:</strong><br>
                The Governor represents New Jersey in dealings with other states and the federal government, and acts as the face of the state during major events and emergencies.
