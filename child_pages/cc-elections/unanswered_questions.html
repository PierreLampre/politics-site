                <p>Welcome to our &quot;Unanswered Questions&quot; section, a culmination of extensive research
                   highlighting the glaring gaps in election-related information provided by our county. </p>
                <p>
                    These queries aren’t propelled by partisan interests but are genuine, good-faith inquiries arising from
                    observed ambiguities—reflecting concerns any discerning voter might encounter. These
                    questions underscore the information void that remains to be filled for voters to make truly
                    informed decisions. The intention is to shed light on these unanswered aspects, fostering a
                    more transparent, informed, and engaged electorate.</p>
                 <p>We encourage all visitors to reflect on these questions, seek answers, and engage in dialogues to uncover the 
                    intricacies of our electoral system and reinforce the integrity of our democratic processes.</p>

                <P>1. Why are only 2 out of 4 primary election candidates featured on the county democrats 
                    <a href="https://cumberlandnjdems.com/elections/our-democratic-candidates/">website</a>? While the party 
                    could be exercising their right to endorse certain candidates, that does not seem to be explicitly stated. 
                    If they are exercising a specific endorsement, what is the reason? Whatever the reason, 
                    <a href="https://perellaandsmithforcumberland.com/">here</a> is the website 
                    for the other two candidates.
                </P>

                <p>2. In regards to the aforementioned candidates that seem to be endorsed by the county democrat party, what is their 
                    agenda and platform? The county website provides general background information and experience regarding the candidates, 
                    but very little or no information regarding issues facing the county and how they would handle them.
                </p>

                <p>3. Regarding the 4 candidates for the county commissioner race, how are they specifically differentiated from each other? 
                    In other words, in regards to specific issues facing the county, how would choosing any one of them produce different expected 
                    outcomes?
                </p>

                <p> 4. Similarly, thinking forward to the ultimate general election in November, how would voting for the primary candidates for 
                    county commissioner produce different expected outcomes than the incumbents? In other words, there are 2 republican incumbents 
                    running for re-election. Since they are already doing the job, why would voting for any of the democrat primary candidates be a 
                    significant difference or improvement upon how things are currently being handled?
                </p>

                <p>5. Similarly, how would voting for any of the candidates in either the US Senate or US House of Representative candidates be 
                    significantly different or an improvement upon the incumbents?

                </p>

                <p>6. Will there be any public events between now and the primary election where voters can meet the democrat primary candidates? 
                    You can clearly see on their <a href="https://cumberlandnjdems.com/events/">website</a> that events aren't regularly updated, 
                    and we are unaware of any public events at the county level, such as meet and greets, town halls, etc. This leaves a high chance 
                    that local voters do not directly know their 'representatives'. By contrast, you can see on the 
                    <a href="https://www.ccrrogop.org/event-calendar">county republican site</a> a regularly 
                    updated calendar, with a bi-weekly breakfast that candidates regularly attend.
                </p>
                
                <p>7. If any events become posted on the county democrat party site, will they include all the candidates or only the ones who 
                    seem to be endorsed?
