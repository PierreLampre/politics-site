            <div class="ua-short-description">
                <p>Welcome to our &quot;Unanswered Questions&quot; section, a culmination of extensive research
                   highlighting the glaring gaps in election-related information provided by our county. </p>
                <p>
                    These queries aren’t propelled by partisan interests but are genuine, good-faith inquiries arising from
                    observed ambiguities—reflecting concerns any discerning voter might encounter. These
                    questions underscore the information void that remains to be filled for voters to make truly
                    informed decisions. The intention is to shed light on these unanswered aspects, fostering a
                    more transparent, informed, and engaged electorate.</p>
                 <p>We encourage all visitors to reflect on these questions, seek answers, and engage in dialogues to uncover the 
                    intricacies of our electoral system and reinforce the integrity of our democratic processes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ua-content">
                <P>1. Who is Charles Laspata, the Democrat candidate for State Senator? Did he literally ‘ghost’ the
                campaign as the Atlantic City Press recently reported? Is this not an indicator of lack of cohesiveness 
                within the democrat party? Could they not have replaced him on the ticket?</P>

                <p>2. If Charles Laspata is not actually a legitimate candidate, will that make Mike Testa (the
                candidate for the Republicans) win by default? Without a legitimate challenger , would we as a
                community feel as though his re-election was truly meritorious? Furthermore, if the county
                doesn’t have dedicated events such as town halls, debates, etc, are election winners winning
                meritoriously?</p>

                <p>3. It seems as though Erik Simonsen and Antwan McClellan present themselves as a part of Team Testa, with very 
                    similar messaging online. However, at public events some individual perspectives arise. Can they offer up any 
                    individual perspectives in formal messaging that might give us a clearer picture of their individual agendas, 
                    especially since independent minded voters may not simply vote party-line?

                </p>

                <p> 4. Similarly, Damita White-Morris and Eddie Bonner seem to have paired up, and John Capizola and La Rae Smith 
                    seem to have paired up. What can those candidates offer up individually to help independent-minded voters make 
                    clear choices as opposed to voting party-line?

                </p>

                <p>5. Art Marchand's agenda seems to be focused on improving the overall quality of life in the county so family's like 
                    his can thrive and prosper. But how does he plan to accomplish that in terms of policy, action-plans, and tax funded 
                    programs?

                </p>

                <p>6. Is Damita White-Morris’ only agenda issue education? It seems as though she wants to increase
                    education funding to update school buildings and salaries… How exactly does she propose to
                    accomplish this? 

                </p>

                <p>7. The topic of equity came up at the candidate's forum and White-Morris' reply was based on vague talking points. 
                    Could she elaborate on the specifics of that topic, meaning what specific goals she has in terms of 
                    legislation and any ideas which may affect tax funded institutions?

                </p>

                <p>8. Similarly, when asked about handling the budget, White-Morris' answers were a bit vague. Perhaps she knows there 
                    are particular issues with the current budget, particular grants we are not currently using, or specific people 
                    she knows who ought to be held accountable for previous inappropriate use of funds. Can she clarify or was she 
                    simply offering common sense approaches to the budget?

                </p>

                <p>9. Dr. Perella has advocated for various LGBTQ+IA issues numerous times on social media and in public. Can they 
                    clarify what specific goals they have in terms of legislation, policy, and any ideas which may affect tax funded 
                    institutions and programs?

                </p>

                <p>10. Dr. Perella was the only candidate at the candidate's forum who opposed armed security in schools. There was 
                    also a bit of back and forth regarding the reasoning, in which they claimed the data doesn't support it and there 
                    have been instances in which armed security did not prevent gun violence in schools. Would they like to follow-up 
                    on the topic?

                </p>11. Dr. Perella also seems to have taken pro-choice, pro-equity, and anti-patriarchy stances on social media, but 
                it's not quite clear exactly what they advocate for in terms of policy and ideas which affect tax funded institutions. 
                Could they follow up with specific, clear stances?

                <p>12. Eddie Bonner seems to have teamed up with Damita White-Morris on the campaign trail. However, it seems as though 
                    he may be piggy-backing off of White-Morris' campaign, especially given that I have attended numerous events 
                    and have yet to see him. Would he care to follow up and make it clear where he stands as a politician, 
                    especially for independent-minded voters who might not necessarily vote party-line?

                </p>

                <p>13.Jim Sauro's agenda seems to be focused on developing businesses and attracting jobs to the county. Could he 
                    elaborate how he will accomplish that in terms of policy, action-plans, and tax-funded programs?
                </p>

                <p>14. Given that Capizola was appointed instead of elected when Commissioner Castellini retired, and the party 
                    messaging for Capizola is a bit surface level, would he care to elaborate his political vision including his 
                    agenda and policy priorities?

                </p>

                <p>15. Would Capizola care to elaborate on why he is strongly against school vouchers?

                </p>

                <p>16. At the candidate's forum, Capizola briefly spoke about being a recent first time gun owner. Would he care to 
                    elaborate on his stance on gun rights and gun violence?

                </p>

                <p>17. Would Mike Donato and Robert Austino like to put forward their positions on how they would handle gun violence, 
                    illegal guns, homelessness, the drug epidemic, and dangerous off-road vehicles?

                </p>

                <p>17. There have been rumors circulating regarding Dr. Perella's picture not being included on campaign advertising. 
                    Would anyone from the democrat party care to comment on that?

                </p>

                <p>18. Would Sandy Taylor like to elaborate on how she would handle developing eco-tourism and how she would address 
                    poverty, homelessness, and the drug epidemic?

                </p>

                <p>19. With the lack of press coverage in the area, can we really be sure the available candidate information is 
                    properly verified through checks and balances? Are any of the candidates willing to support an action plan to 
                    rectify this problem?
                </p>

                <p>20. With the lack of cohesion within the Republican party on a national level, can we be sure that our county's 
                    Republican party remain cohesive if elected?
                </p>

                <p>21. With the recent overturning of Roe v Wade bringing the issue of abortion policy to the state level, what are 
                    our Senate and Assembly candidates specific policies regarding abortion? What is their ideal policy and how far 
                    might they be willing to negotiate towards a compromise given that this is such a polarizing topic?
                </p>

                <p>22. Given that Donald Trump is being indicted in Georgia at least in part due to an alleged alternate slate of 
                    electors being used to disrupt the election, what can our candidates tell us about how our state's parties select 
                    their slates of electors? Furthermore, what can they tell us to ensure us that no election funny business is going 
                    on?
                </p>
                
                <p>23. Why is the office of the surrogate relevant to voting? Couldn’t either of the candidates
                modernize the office forms and provide better in-person service (their proposed agendas)?</p>
