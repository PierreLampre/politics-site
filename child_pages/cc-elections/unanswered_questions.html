                Welcome to our &quot;Unanswered Questions&quot; section, a culmination of extensive research
highlighting the glaring gaps in election-related information provided by our county. These
queries aren’t propelled by partisan interests but are genuine, good-faith inquiries arising from
observed ambiguities—reflecting concerns any discerning voter might encounter. These
questions underscore the information void that remains to be filled for voters to make truly
informed decisions. The intention is to shed light on these unanswered aspects, fostering a
more transparent, informed, and engaged electorate. We encourage all visitors to reflect on
these questions, seek answers, and engage in dialogues to uncover the intricacies of our
electoral system and reinforce the integrity of our democratic processes.

                <P>1. Who is Charles Laspata, the Democrat candidate for State Senator? Did he literally ‘ghost’ the
                campaign as the Atlantic City Press recently reported?</P>
                <p>2. If Charles Laspata is not actually a legitimate candidate, will that make Mike Testa (the
                candidate for the Republicans) win by default? Without a legitimate challenger , would we as a
                community feel as though his re-election was truly meritorious? Furthermore, if the county
                doesn’t have dedicated events such as town halls, debates, etc, are election winners winning
                meritoriously?</p>
                <p>3. Is Damita White-Morris’ only agenda issue education? It seems as though she wants to increase
                education funding to update school buildings and salaries… How exactly does she propose to
                accomplish this?</p>
                <p>4. What are the relevant issues which the next sheriff will deal with? How will each of the
                candidates handle them? Why is one candidates proposed agenda better than the others?</p>
                <p>5. Why is the office of the surrogate relevant to voting? Couldn’t either of the candidates
                modernize the office forms and provide better in-person service (their proposed agendas)?</p>
                <p>6. What is Capizola’s personal agenda vs the democrat party’s messaging? It seems as though he
                was not voted in through the normal election process, so it could be helpful to know how he
                feels personally about politics.</p>
                <p>7. What is La Rae Smith’s personal agenda vs the democrat party’s messaging?</p>
                <p>8. What are Capizola and La Rae Smith’s policy positions on recent and ongoing issues?</p>
                <p>9. What are Erik Simonsen and Antwon McLellan’s personal agendas vs their party messaging?</p>
                <p>10. How does Sandra Taylor plan to implement her agenda?</p>
                <p>11. What is Art Marchand’s personal agenda? How does he plan to implement it? What are his
                stances on recent and ongoing issues?</p>
                <p>12. Is James Sauro’s only agenda issue to attract business to the county? Is his only implementation
                of that to leverage student work at the county college?</p>
