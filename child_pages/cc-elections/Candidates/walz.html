              <h6 class="page-title">Tim Walz</h6>
              <p>
                Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was a member of the national guard for nearly 25 years, was a congressman for over a decade, and has been governor for nearly five years. 
                During that time he has supported the Affordable Care Act, improved Veterans Affairs, voted for the National Defense Authorization Act, supported farmers in rural 
                Minnesota, promoted funding for public schools and making college more affordable, and generally tried to reduce carbon emissions and promoted renewable energy. He seems
                to have a moderate stance on gun control, being a gun owner himself while pushing common sense gun law legislation. While he does have a lot of experience and has made many 
                accomplishments, it is still unclear what the specific Harris-Walz agenda will be, since as of today 8/9/2024 no agenda is posted on their campaign site. One might be able 
                to speculate based on the <a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/">Democrat Party Platform</a>, but we here at InformTheVote don't want to speculate 
                too much. Hopefully as the campaign season evolves his platform will become clearer.
