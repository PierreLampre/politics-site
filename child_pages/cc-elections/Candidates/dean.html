              <p>
                Rodney A. Dean is running himself as a 'man of the people in the valley, not like the career politicians on the mountaintop.'
                He prides himself on getting involved on a face-to-face basis with constituents and will have an open-door policy if elected.
                He believes the older generation needs to make up for the lack of attention they gave in regards to teaching the younger generations.
                He also strongly believes that politicians should stay consistent with who they are as opposed to the all too common turncoat practices
                seen in government. Inform the Vote would also like to mention the prompt and consistent communication when we reached out to him
                regarding his campaign.

                    <li>Rodney is a big advocate for starting boxing gyms throughout the community as he believes there are 
                        numerous benefits that can follow from solid boxing programs:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1. Boxing gyms help keep kids off the streets so they will get into less trouble.
                        <br>
                        2. Boxing teaches valuable life lessons such as hard work, discipline, and respect for others.
                        <br>
                        3. Boxing lessons can help reduce gun violence as learning basic self defense gives people an option to 
                        protect themselves rather than defaulting to reaching for a gun.
                        <br>
                        4. Self defense through boxing can also give kids who are being bullied a chance to defend themselves when 
                        necessary.
                        <br>
                        5. Being involved in boxing gyms can lead to career pathways later in life as opposed to being influenced to 
                        sell drugs on the streets.
