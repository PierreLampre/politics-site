                <h6 class="page-title">J.R. Carman</h6> 
                <p> J.R. Carman is seeking re-election to the Hopewell–Shiloh Board of Education (Hopewell Crest School). In a public statement, 
                    he frames his role around “protect and serve,” emphasizing student and staff safety (a <em>defense-in-depth</em> approach), 
                    intellectual growth and individuality, a positive school climate with new curriculum initiatives, partnership with parents, 
                    support for educators and administrators, and conservative fiscal stewardship on behalf of all taxpayers. <br><br> In a 
                    recent long-form radio conversation with InformTheVoteNJ, Carman discussed civic education and the character of public 
                    officials, noting (on-air) that Hopewell Crest incorporates civics in every grade and identifying himself as the Board’s 
                    curriculum committee chair. District-specific plans, measurable targets, or recent vote explanations were not provided in 
                    writing or on-air, but if he provides that at some point during the campaign season, he will be on track to being fully transparent this election.

                <h6 class="page-title">J.R. Carman</h6> 
                <p> Relative to the Cumberland County status quo, Carman’s transparency and accessibility is <strong>on the right track</strong> as of <strong>August 25, 2025</strong>: 
                    he offered a public statement and participated in a substantive radio discussion (good accessibility), and is booked for a campaign-specific interview on the InformTheVoteNJ
                    radio hour on Tuesday 9/9 from 5-6pm. That being said, he did not complete the site’s structured questionnaire and has not published an issue-by-issue brief with concrete, 
                    current district specifics and action plans. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Carman's public statement highlights values—safety, academics, parent partnership, staff support, and fiscal stewardship—and the interview focuses 
                    on civic education and governance philosophy... all of which fit into a solid agenda and governing ideology.
                    What’s still missing for voters are concise, written stances on current Hopewell Crest priorities (e.g., safety implementation details, budget/levy outlook, facilities, staffing, 
                    curriculum changes), recent vote rationales, and measurable goals for the next term. Such clarification would fit neatly into an issues section on his page.
                    <br><br>
                    A short follow-up—a list of issues, positions, and action plans would quickly move this toward a higher transparency tier.

                    Hopewell school board member <strong>J.R. Carman</strong> (host of the <em>New Jersey Constitutional Republican Radio Hour</em>) sits 
                    down with <strong>Steven Solof</strong> of InformTheVoteNJ.com to connect constitutional foundations with local civic practice. We dig 
                    into why the U.S. is a <strong>democratically elected constitutional federal republic</strong> (not pure democracy), how 
                    <strong>populism</strong> and reaction politics erode trust, why <strong>character</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong> matter in 
                    local candidates, and how <strong>civics education</strong> (including local civics) underpins an informed electorate.
                    We also touch <strong>term limits vs. educated voters</strong>, the <strong>Millville petition</strong> kerfuffle, and classic 
                    insights from <strong>Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson,</strong> and <strong>Adams</strong>.

        A 50-minute, issues-focused conversation with incumbent school board member <strong>J.R. Carman</strong> about governance, parent involvement, 
        security (“defense in depth”), academic individuality vs. one-size-fits-all standards, and fiscal planning for space needs at Hopewell Crest. 
        The interview also traces Carman’s civic philosophy (history, theology, constitutionalism) and emphasizes keeping parents central while schools 
        supplement learning.

                        continually looking for incremental improvements (e.g., better lighting, additional cameras, vigilance training).
