                <h6 class="page-title">J.R. Carman</h6> 
                <p> J.R. Carman is seeking re-election to the Hopewell–Shiloh Board of Education (Hopewell Crest School). In a public statement, 
                    he frames his role around “protect and serve,” emphasizing student and staff safety (a <em>defense-in-depth</em> approach), 
                    intellectual growth and individuality, a positive school climate with new curriculum initiatives, partnership with parents, 
                    support for educators and administrators, and conservative fiscal stewardship on behalf of all taxpayers. <br><br> In a 
                    recent long-form radio conversation with InformTheVoteNJ, Carman discussed civic education and the character of public 
                    officials, noting (on-air) that Hopewell Crest incorporates civics in every grade and identifying himself as the Board’s 
                    curriculum committee chair. District-specific plans, measurable targets, or recent vote explanations were not provided in 
                    writing. <br><br> Click the red x at the top of this box and then scroll down for more in-depth information and sources. </p>

                <h6 class="page-title">J.R. Carman</h6> 
                <p> Relative to the Cumberland County status quo, Carman’s accessibility is <strong>mixed</strong> as of <strong>August 25, 2025</strong>: 
                    he offered a public statement and participated in a substantive radio discussion (good accessibility), but he did not complete the 
                    site’s structured questionnaire and has not published an issue-by-issue brief with concrete, current district specifics. 
                    <br><br> 
                    The statement highlights values—safety, academics, parent partnership, staff support, and fiscal stewardship—and the interview focuses 
                    on civic education and governance philosophy. What’s still missing for voters are concise, written stances on current Hopewell Crest 
                    priorities (e.g., safety implementation details, budget/levy outlook, facilities, staffing, curriculum changes), recent vote rationales, 
                    and measurable goals for the next term. 
                    <br><br>
                    A short follow-up—bullet list of issues and positions, examples of recent board actions,and/or a 30–60 minute Q&amp;A centered on district 
                    decisions—would quickly move this toward a higher transparency tier.
