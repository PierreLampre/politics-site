              <h6 class="page-title">Antwan McClellan</h6>
              <p>          

                Assemblymen Erik Simonsen and Antwan McClellan have historically been more accessible than many local candidates in Cumberland County, 
                regularly attending Republican breakfasts and participating in public meet-and-greet events. That pattern already placed them 
                above average compared to the regional status quo, where many candidates remain largely invisible between election cycles... or at least 
                invisible to people who aren't already political insiders.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since the end of the primary election, both have made plans to expand their outreach further heading into the general election season. While 
                their joint radio interview scheduled for July 1 had to be adjusted—Erik ultimately needed to cancel—Antwan followed through and appeared 
                live on air. Erik has indicated he will reschedule his radio interview in the near future, and both plan to participate in a longer, 
                podcast-style interview later in the summer.
                <br>
                <br>
                If these commitments materialize, they will be on track to provide a reasonable amount of information and public dialogue before October, 
                when most voters begin to focus on the race in earnest.                 
                <br>
                <br>
                Given the longstanding pattern of inaccessibility that plagues many campaigns related to Cumberland County, InformTheVoteNJ will continue 
                monitoring closely to see whether these promised interviews and public appearances occur as planned.
                <br>
                <br>
                For now, based on demonstrated efforts to improve communication this cycle, Simonsen and McClellan’s transparency and accessibility merit an 
                updated rating of average to above average, with cautious optimism that further improvements will follow.

                    Assemblyman Antwan McClellan has sponsored a broad range of legislation focused on regional equity, small business growth, and infrastructure access—particularly for 
                    South Jersey. His proposals include expanding loan access to broadband providers (A3050), eliminating tax exemption caps in Urban Enterprise Zones (A3059), and creating
                    manufacturing-focused grants and marketing for southern counties (A3057, A3058). He has also supported healthcare measures like requiring mammogram coverage based on medical 
                    need (A3053, “Michelle’s Law”) and trauma-informed training for child custody cases (A3062). On the accountability front, McClellan has advocated for timely crime data 
                    reporting (A3063), restoring in-person state services (A3054), and ensuring all counties have access to MVC services (A3052). He has also worked on policy reforms around 
                    property taxation (A3064, ACR95) and veterans' services (A3055, AJR212), while expressing concern over recent DEP environmental rulemaking (ACR150). Overall, his record 
                    highlights a commitment to practical local governance, economic development in underserved regions, and improving access to state-level services.

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Candidates Forum Statements from 2023 (he was running for the same position)</h4>
            <div class="experience can-sec">
                At the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School, when asked about what makes him most qualified for the specific 
            position of assemblyman, McClellan spoke about his commitment to God, family, and community. He also said that he shows 
            up to do his job as incumbent every day, not just during election season. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When asked about addressing the state's budget deficit and maintaing fiscal responsibility, McClellan spoke about the state 
            wasting money on a French museum, and then questioned the fairness of Bergen County receiving money for a jail and money 
            going to Hudson County's infrastructure. He wants more transparency in the budgeting process through requesting more time 
            to look over budget proposals. He wants to use the money he is able to acquire through these oversights to invest in schools.
            <br>
            <br>
            When asked how to handle gun violence, McClellan spoke about taking the hand cuffs off the officers (let them do their jobs),
            part of the problem being that guns are being transported across state lines, and suggesting a gun buyback program.
