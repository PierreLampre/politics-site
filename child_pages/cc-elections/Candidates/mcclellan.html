              <h6 class="page-title">Antwan McClellan</h6>
              <p>          

                Assemblymen Erik Simonsen and Antwan McClellan have historically been more accessible than many local candidates in Cumberland County, 
                regularly attending Republican breakfasts and participating in public meet-and-greet events. That pattern already placed them 
                above average compared to the regional status quo, where many candidates remain largely invisible between election cycles... or at least 
                invisible to people who aren't already political insiders.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since the end of the primary election, both have made plans to expand their outreach further heading into the general election season. While 
                their joint radio interview scheduled for July 1 had to be adjusted—Erik ultimately needed to cancel—Antwan followed through and appeared 
                live on air. Erik has indicated he will reschedule his radio interview in the near future, and both plan to participate in a longer, 
                podcast-style interview later in the summer.
                <br>
                <br>
                If these commitments materialize, they will be on track to provide a reasonable amount of information and public dialogue before October, 
                when most voters begin to focus on the race in earnest.                 
                <br>
                <br>
                Given the longstanding pattern of inaccessibility that plagues many campaigns related to Cumberland County, InformTheVoteNJ will continue 
                monitoring closely to see whether these promised interviews and public appearances occur as planned.
                <br>
                <br>
                For now, based on demonstrated efforts to improve communication this cycle, Simonsen and McClellan’s transparency and accessibility merit an 
                updated rating of average to above average, with cautious optimism that further improvements will follow.

                <strong>Explanation</strong>
            </summary>
            Assemblymen Erik Simonsen and Antwan McClellan have historically been more accessible than many local candidates in Cumberland County, 
                regularly attending Republican breakfasts and participating in public meet-and-greet events. That pattern already placed them 
                above average compared to the regional status quo, where many candidates remain largely invisible between election cycles... or at least 
                invisible to people who aren't already political insiders.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since the end of the primary election, both have made plans to expand their outreach further heading into the general election season. While 
                their joint radio interview scheduled for July 1 had to be adjusted—Erik ultimately needed to cancel—Antwan followed through and appeared 
                live on air. Erik has indicated he will reschedule his radio interview in the near future, and both plan to participate in a longer, 
                podcast-style interview later in the summer.
                <br>
                <br>
                If these commitments materialize, they will be on track to provide a reasonable amount of information and public dialogue before October, 
                when most voters begin to focus on the race in earnest.                 
                <br>
                <br>
                Given the longstanding pattern of inaccessibility that plagues many campaigns related to Cumberland County, InformTheVoteNJ will continue 
                monitoring closely to see whether these promised interviews and public appearances occur as planned.
                <br>
                <br>
                For now, based on demonstrated efforts to improve communication this cycle, Simonsen and McClellan’s transparency and accessibility merit an 
                updated rating of average to above average, with cautious optimism that further improvements will follow.

                        <p>
                        Assemblyman Antwan McClellan centers his agenda on protecting South Jersey’s distinct communities — 
                        shore towns, bayshore, farm country, and small cities — and making sure Trenton stops treating LD1 as an afterthought. 
                        He emphasizes returning resources to Cape May, Cumberland, and southern Atlantic, supporting tourism, agriculture, and local industry so 
                        families can build their futures here rather than moving away.

                        McClellan ties community stability to safe streets, parental voice in schools, and attainable housing. 
                        He supports policies that lower the cost of living, protect seniors on fixed incomes, and keep neighborhoods safe through 
                        effective policing and first-responder support.

                        From boardwalk enterprises to bayshore marinas and main-street shops, McClellan views small business as the backbone of LD1. 
                        He advocates cutting red tape, resisting new fees and “sin-tax” hikes, and fostering year-round economic activity that complements 
                        seasonal tourism. Workforce development and partnerships with community colleges are core to his vision of local opportunity.

                        <p>
                        With New Jerseyans already facing some of the nation’s highest taxes, McClellan opposes what he calls executive overreach and 
                        budget practices that rely on ever-higher taxes and fees (e.g., on cigarettes, alcohol, and gambling). 
                        His agenda stresses balanced budgets, taxpayer value, and accountability for spending priorities.

                        <p>
                        He supports long-delayed regional upgrades — notably the Route 55 expansion for safety, evacuation, and commerce — 
                        and consistent state attention to local roads, bridges, and ports. Infrastructure should reflect how South Jersey actually lives, 
                        works, and evacuates during storms.

                        <p>
                        McClellan backs fair, practical rules for the fishing industry, investment in working waterfronts, and protections for farmland. 
                        He argues that environmental stewardship must be balanced with keeping coastal and agricultural economies viable for the next generation.

                        <p>
                        A consistent theme for McClellan is reintroducing civics — including the basics of local government — into school curricula so 
                        young people understand how counties, municipalities, and school boards work. Better informed citizens make stronger communities.

                        Beyond legislation, McClellan highlights hands-on service — with legislative offices in Vineland and Cape May Court House — 
                        helping residents with state agencies and casework. His background in the Cape May County Sheriff’s Office and 15 years coaching 
                        girls’ basketball reflect an agenda rooted in everyday service and accessibility.

                        McClellan has raised alarms about proposed NJDEP changes to base flood elevations that could force costly home raisings across the

                        McClellan is open to exploring county-facilitated, nonpartisan voter information (questionnaires, basic candidate pages) while noting the need 
                        to consult county clerks on cost and implementation. He also supports rebuilding local press coverage — recalling past regional TV news — 
                        so citizens can follow evolving issues beyond one-time questionnaires.

                        He encourages residents to contact LD1’s legislative offices for help with state matters (e.g., MVC, unemployment) and coordinates with 
                        federal offices as needed. McClellan stresses direct engagement over rumor mills and invites voters to reach out, ask questions, and get facts.

                At the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School, when asked about what makes him most qualified for the specific 
            position of assemblyman, McClellan spoke about his commitment to God, family, and community. He also said that he shows 
            up to do his job as incumbent every day, not just during election season.

            When asked about addressing the state's budget deficit and maintaing fiscal responsibility, McClellan spoke about the state 
            wasting money on a French museum, and then questioned the fairness of Bergen County receiving money for a jail and money 
            going to Hudson County's infrastructure. He wants more transparency in the budgeting process through requesting more time 
            to look over budget proposals. He wants to use the money he is able to acquire through these oversights to invest in schools.

            When asked how to handle gun violence, McClellan spoke about taking the hand cuffs off the officers (let them do their jobs),
            part of the problem being that guns are being transported across state lines, and suggesting a gun buyback program.
