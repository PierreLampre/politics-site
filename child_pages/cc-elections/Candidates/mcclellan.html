                Antwan McClellan is a New Jersey Assemblyman representing the 1st Legislative District since 2020 and currently serves as the Assembly Minority Deputy Leader. A lifelong 
                resident of Ocean City, McClellan has held local office on the City Council and Board of Education. He also serves in the Cape May County Sheriff's Department and is active 
                in community organizations like the Ocean City Historical Museum and South Jersey Field of Dreams. His legislative focus includes public safety, economic justice, ballot

              <h6 class="page-title">Antwan McClellan</h6>
              <p>          

                Assemblymen Erik Simonsen and Antwan McClellan are more accessible than many local candidates in Cumberland County, regularly attending Republican breakfasts and occasionally 
                participating in meet-and-greet events—an effort that puts them above average compared to the regional status quo. However, their official communication channels still fall 
                short of delivering clear, publicly accessible policy positions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Their joint bio/platform on the Cumberland County Regular Republican Organization website is vague, offering broad themes without detailed explanations or legislative 
                priorities. A link meant to highlight their voting history instead redirects to general NJ Legislature pages, requiring voters to piece together records themselves rather 
                than reviewing curated summaries or forward-looking plans.
                <br>
                <br>
                While they technically remain reachable for those deeply involved in local politics, the barrier to meaningful platform clarity remains high. Compared to Democratic 
                challengers Brandon Saffold and Carolyn Rush—who responded to outreach, participated in a lengthy interview, and allowed for transparent documentation of their 
                stances—Simonsen and McClellan have not engaged with our information-gathering process. Their platform and record could be clarified with minimal effort, but no such 
                cooperation has materialized. However, in the interest of being totally fair, my ability to access Rush and Saffold happened largely in part out of random chance, so 
                direct comparisons still remain tough.
                <br>
                <br>
                They are expected to attend a Republican-organized meet and greet in May, but this too was only known through insider channels. In sum: they outperform the average 
                candidate in local accessibility, but still fall short of the kind of transparency and voter-friendly communication the public deserves.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, Simonsen receives an average to slightly above average rating for transparency and accessibility.

                    Assemblyman Antwan McClellan has sponsored a broad range of legislation focused on regional equity, small business growth, and infrastructure access—particularly for 
                    South Jersey. His proposals include expanding loan access to broadband providers (A3050), eliminating tax exemption caps in Urban Enterprise Zones (A3059), and creating
                    manufacturing-focused grants and marketing for southern counties (A3057, A3058). He has also supported healthcare measures like requiring mammogram coverage based on medical 
                    need (A3053, “Michelle’s Law”) and trauma-informed training for child custody cases (A3062). On the accountability front, McClellan has advocated for timely crime data 
                    reporting (A3063), restoring in-person state services (A3054), and ensuring all counties have access to MVC services (A3052). He has also worked on policy reforms around 
                    property taxation (A3064, ACR95) and veterans' services (A3055, AJR212), while expressing concern over recent DEP environmental rulemaking (ACR150). Overall, his record 
                    highlights a commitment to practical local governance, economic development in underserved regions, and improving access to state-level services.

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Candidates Forum Statements from 2023 (he was running for the same position)</h4>
            <div class="experience can-sec">
                At the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School, when asked about what makes him most qualified for the specific 
            position of assemblyman, McClellan spoke about his commitment to God, family, and community. He also said that he shows 
            up to do his job as incumbent every day, not just during election season. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When asked about addressing the state's budget deficit and maintaing fiscal responsibility, McClellan spoke about the state 
            wasting money on a French museum, and then questioned the fairness of Bergen County receiving money for a jail and money 
            going to Hudson County's infrastructure. He wants more transparency in the budgeting process through requesting more time 
            to look over budget proposals. He wants to use the money he is able to acquire through these oversights to invest in schools.
            <br>
            <br>
            When asked how to handle gun violence, McClellan spoke about taking the hand cuffs off the officers (let them do their jobs),
            part of the problem being that guns are being transported across state lines, and suggesting a gun buyback program.
