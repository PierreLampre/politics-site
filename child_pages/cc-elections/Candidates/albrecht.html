              <h6 class="page-title">Douglas Albrecht</h6>
              <p>          

                Doug Albrecht is the longest-serving member of the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners and one of two Republican incumbents running unopposed in the 2025 
                primary. His longstanding experience and familiarity with county operations make him a key figure in ongoing policy conversations—from budget negotiations to 
                infrastructure projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Recently, Albrecht distinguished himself by participating in a one-hour radio interview with InformTheVoteNJ, offering substantive answers on complex county matters 
                such as the Nabb Avenue Extension and the Middle Mile Broadband initiative. Rather than relying on vague talking points, Albrecht addressed direct and sometimes 
                uncomfortable questions with a level of candor that many voters rarely get to hear—especially from candidates not facing primary opposition. His willingness to 
                participate in that format, and this early in the election cycle, reflects a notable commitment to transparency.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the same time, it's worth acknowledging a shift in one of the more consistent venues for Republican visibility: the bi-weekly GOP breakfasts. During my process 
                for nearly two years, these gatherings operated as semi-formal, civic-minded meetings open to Democrats, independents, and members of the press. But following public 
                critique of transparency issues in a local race, it was recently announced that press and Democrats would no longer be welcome. While the meetings still serve as a 
                regular touchpoint for Republican insiders, this change narrows public access to candidates like Albrecht—making direct interviews and open forums even more 
                important for reaching a broader audience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Despite that shift, Albrecht has taken initiative. In a political environment where many campaigns remain vague or inaccessible, his participation in a long-form 
                discussion helped unlock clarity on long-standing county projects and challenges. Voters may still have questions—but at least with Albrecht, they’re getting 
                real answers early on with plenty of time until November to make the full picture clear.

              <h6 class="page-title">Douglas Albrecht</h6>
              <p>          

                Douglas Albrecht is a two-term incumbent seeking a third term on the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners. He remains highly visible—attending GOP breakfasts, 
                engaging at county events, and hosting a weekly radio show. His Republican Party bio mentions involvement in issues like public health, literacy, income inequality, 
                taxation, and tourism, as well as infrastructure projects like the county park system.
                <br><br>
                On Monday 5/10, we did a radio interview on his weekly show to have an extended discussion to clarify his campaign messaging. 
                This is a significant positive step, though one limited by the format and timing.
                <br><br>
                Albrecht stands apart from less engaged candidates through his regular presence and willingness to acknowledge real problems. 
                <br><br>
                Given his access, experience, and community presence, Albrecht is well-positioned to not only offer a fully informed reelection case, he is uniquely positioned to help 
                inform the public at large what is going on in county-level politics because it is our understanding that he is the longest serving commissioner. That knowledge could help 
                voters cut through potential noise and help make meaningfully informed voting choices. 
                At present, he receives an “above average” transparency rating, with the potential to reach the top tier by simply putting the extent of his knowledge out there 
                so the county can clearly look it over when the general election comes in November.

              <p>          

                Douglas Albrecht is a Republican incumbent running for his third term as a Cumberland County Commissioner. With a background in business and public service, 
                Albrecht emphasizes fiscal responsibility and common-sense solutions to the county’s long-standing issues. A lifelong Vineland resident and small business 
                owner, he holds degrees in Political Science, Economics, and an MBA.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout his time in office, Albrecht has served on key committees and acted as liaison to the Library Board, Board of Elections, Bayshore Council, and 
                Recreation Committee. He has helped lead a major renovation of the Cumberland County Library and has pushed for the creation of a countywide parks system. 
                His recent work includes budget oversight on the Finance Committee and voicing concerns over state-imposed election changes and environmental regulations that 
                he believes disproportionately affect the region.
                <br>
                <br>
                In recent speeches, Albrecht has criticized past Democratic-led projects like the now-abandoned county jail construction, citing mismanagement and lack of 
                contractual oversight that left taxpayers with millions in sunk costs. He’s also taken a firm stance against closing the juvenile detention center and has 
                noted the GOP’s success in avoiding tax increases over the past two years.
                <br>
                <br>
                Albrecht sees improving literacy, health, and household income as essential to lifting Cumberland County from its low rankings statewide, and he believes 
                these problems require practical leadership and transparent management.

            <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
              <p>In this 55-minute radio interview, Commissioner Doug Albrecht joins InformTheVoteNJ.com's Steven Solof for a wide-ranging conversation about his re-election campaign, the current state of county affairs, and long-term priorities. Although the Cumberland County Regular Republican Organization provides a platform bio outlining some of Albrecht’s stances, he does not have a dedicated campaign website. This interview is intended to go deeper—giving voters a chance to hear him explain his work in his own words.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility and Measurable Results:</strong><br>
              Albrecht discusses key strategies like holding the line on taxes for three consecutive years while highlighting improvements in public health rankings and infrastructure upgrades across the county.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Modernization and Emergency Response:</strong><br>
              The conversation touches on efforts to stabilize core county functions, expand broadband access in rural areas, and respond to public emergencies effectively. Projects like the Middle Mile fiber initiative and South Ave Culvert are explored in detail.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Transparency and Public Communication:</strong><br>
              Steven introduces the idea of a quarterly report to help bridge the information gap between elected officials and residents. Albrecht agrees this could improve public understanding and address the challenge of under-communicated government work.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Civic Engagement and Education:</strong><br>
              Albrecht emphasizes the importance of teaching local civics in schools, instilling a deeper sense of pride in community participation and awareness of how county government impacts daily life.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
              Whether you're lightly engaged or ready to go down the rabbit hole, this interview offers a rare, direct window into the mindset and leadership style of one of Cumberland County’s long-serving commissioners. It's a valuable listen for anyone curious about what’s being done—and what could still be improved—in county government.</p>

                          <strong>South Avenue Culvert Replacement</strong><br><br>
                          This long-delayed Bridgeton culvert rebuild continues to highlight broader infrastructure and permitting issues in Cumberland County. Commissioner Doug Albrecht explained 
                          in a recent interview that although funding, planning, and contractor coordination are complete, the project remains stuck in limbo due to state and federal red tape. 
                          Specifically, <strong>seven separate permits</strong> are required—including from the Coast Guard and Historic Preservation—due to remnants of an old railroad in the area.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                          Albrecht sees this as a textbook example of bureaucratic inefficiency, where expert-approved plans can be delayed indefinitely by a single desk in Trenton or Washington. 
                          He recalled the culvert collapsing two years before Democrats took control of the board and emphasized that the County has done its part—only to be stalled by overlapping 
                          and often contradictory requirements from the New Jersey DEP and other agencies.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                          He also connected the issue to broader problems with state zoning and planning decisions, arguing that local governments often have little say in how infrastructure fits 
                          into community development. He described the DEP as operating more like a “hammer than a carrot,” issuing top-down mandates without local input or accountability.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                          Albrecht expressed optimism that Jack Ciattarelli’s proposed reforms to the DEP—shifting it toward a more responsive, rule-based agency—could directly help Cumberland 
                          County. If elected, Ciattarelli has stated he wants the DEP to act more like a regulatory body that reacts to real problems (like illegal dumping), rather than a 
                          policy-making authority that creates delays by constantly shifting requirements.

                      <p>
                        The **Middle Mile project** was originally designed to install a high-capacity fiber-optic backbone across Cumberland and Salem 
                        Counties, enabling local providers to build out last-mile internet to underserved rural areas. Commissioner Doug Albrecht continues 
                        to defend the initiative as a missed opportunity for Cumberland—not only to modernize broadband access but to **generate revenue** 
                        for the county by leasing fiber lines to private providers.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        Albrecht clarified in a recent interview that Salem County has now taken the lead, after Cumberland’s Board declined to prioritize 
                        the project. Salem secured over $20 million in BEAD (Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment) funding, and plans to extend 
                        last-mile service based on the assumption that the Middle Mile infrastructure will still move forward.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        Albrecht disputes the narrative that the project would have been too costly. He explained that Cumberland’s original commitment 
                        was estimated at $3.2 million, a figure that could have been covered through a mix of in-kind contributions—such as public safety 
                        towers from the County’s 700 MHz system—and strategic budgeting. He also argued that early cost estimates were inflated, and the 
                        County could have broken even or profited over time through line-leasing agreements.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        Despite limited support from his colleagues, Albrecht still sees Middle Mile broadband as a modern utility—essential for attracting 
                        data centers, remote work opportunities, and educational equity. Though disappointed that Cumberland stepped back, he remains 
                        hopeful that Salem’s leadership will eventually bring the project full circle and deliver benefits to the broader region.

                  <summary style="color: blue;"><strong>County Jail Reform & Workforce Stabilization</strong></summary>
                  <p>
                    Cumberland County’s long-troubled jail system has entered a new phase of transformation. Commissioner Doug Albrecht outlined 
                    how the county is now pursuing a regional partnership with Camden County after a failed attempt to create a joint facility with 
                    Salem and Gloucester. He framed the Camden deal as the most <strong>viable option currently on the table</strong>—one that would 
                    reduce travel and overtime costs, improve workforce conditions, and allow Cumberland to share long-term operational expenses with 
                    neighboring counties.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    In the short term, Albrecht says the deal would let Cumberland transfer inmates to Camden without the logistical nightmare of 
                    midnight pickups in Hudson County, where many inmates are currently housed. In the long term, Camden is planning a multi-county 
                    complex where Cumberland would have a vote in key decisions and staffing roles for its officers. Albrecht stressed that his main 
                    concern is making sure Cumberland’s correctional staff and inmate needs are treated fairly under any future arrangement.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    The failed Salem project left behind a controversial <strong>$16 million concrete slab</strong> and roughly <strong>$60 million 
                    in bonded funds</strong>. Albrecht explained that while the slab can’t support a jail, it may still serve as the foundation for 
                    a consolidated government building. This would bring scattered departments under one roof—improving efficiency, eliminating lease 
                    costs, and making better use of existing infrastructure like water, sewer, and HVAC systems already installed on site.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Albrecht emphasized that the bonded funds are not lost—they’re still collecting interest and could be redirected to meet urgent 
                    space and staffing needs in the county. He’s also advocated for practical renovations to the existing jail, including HVAC upgrades, 
                    door repairs, and general maintenance, to ensure safer working conditions while the long-term solution develops.
