              <p>          

                Douglas Albrecht is a two-term Cumberland County Commissioner running for re-election. He brings a background in business and public service, with past roles on Vineland 
                City Council and current leadership on various county-level boards and committees, including Finance, Recreation, the Library Board, and the Board of Elections. His public 
                messaging often emphasizes fiscal conservatism, economic development, literacy, and commonsense solutions to county-wide issues.
                <br>
                <br>
                Albrecht is a familiar face in the community and regularly attends the Republican organization’s bi-weekly breakfast events—offering consistent, in-person access to 
                constituents. However, his campaign remains light on comprehensive public materials, with no formal website or detailed policy documentation currently available for the 
                2025 race. Despite his visibility, voters without direct access to local events may struggle to clearly understand his full platform or how it compares to his opponents.
                <br>
                <br>
                As it stands, Albrecht is more accessible than most—but still leaves room for improvement when it comes to transparency in the digital space.

              <h6 class="page-title">John P. Capizola</h6>
              <p>          

                Douglas Albrecht is currently serving his second term on the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners and is seeking a third. With extensive involvement in local 
                governance—including roles on the county Finance Committee, Library Board, Board of Elections, and the Recreation and Bayshore Councils—he presents as a knowledgeable, 
                civically active representative with strong community ties and a deep understanding of county-level challenges.
                <br>
                <br>
                Which makes it all the more important to assess his transparency through the lens of not whether he’s active, but how effectively he communicates his campaign platform to 
                the public at large.
                <br>
                <br>
                In many ways, Albrecht is among the more visible candidates in Cumberland County. He is known to be highly present in the community and regularly attends the Cumberland 
                County Regular Republican Organization’s bi-weekly breakfasts—events that offer roughly two dozen opportunities a year for voters to engage directly with Republican leaders 
                and candidates. By comparison to the sporadic or non-existent outreach from the local Democratic Party, this structure alone is a significant advantage in accessibility.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, accessibility in-person does not automatically translate to accessibility in messaging. While Albrecht has had multiple opportunities to participate in this 
                platform’s efforts to document candidate agendas, policy stances, and side-by-side comparisons, he has not provided comprehensive campaign materials, filled out 
                questionnaires, or shared detailed updates that would allow voters to easily review his comprehensive views on well known county issues outside of attending a breakfast or 
                reading general summaries on the CCRRO website.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shortly after one of our speech's was given at one of the County Commissioner meetings encouraging countywide participation in a nonpartisan information process like the one 
                on this site, Albrecht expressed that such a proposal might risk "micro-managing campaigns." While that’s a valid concern in the abstract, it doesn't change the reality that 
                public officials—especially incumbents—should already be making their stances easy to find and compare. Furthermore, at a similar meeting, former Commissioner Director Sileo 
                suggested doing a quarterly report to let the public know where we're at with progress on ongoing issues. That would be great, but we are unaware if that has actually 
                been started. Similarly, current Commissioner Director Sauro stated the Commissioner Board is working on a general PR campaign, though we are not sure if that is still a 
                work in progress, or is in reference to sporadic press releases on the County Site's homepage.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s also worth noting that Albrecht, as a long-serving commissioner, should be one of the most equipped candidates to provide issue-based comparisons between himself and his 
                opponents. He has the context, the background, and the experience. So why not write it down? Why not give voters something they can digest, revisit, and share with others?
                <br>
                <br>
                To be clear: Albrecht's public presence and general availability place him above many of his peers when it comes to accessibility. He attends events, speaks to constituents, 
                and provides periodic updates. But in a digital age where voters need centralized, persistent, and easily shareable campaign information, these in-person efforts, while 
                commendable, aren’t enough on their own.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, the door is always open to raise this rating. Submitting a completed candidate questionnaire, participating in a podcast-style interview, or providing a formal 
                breakdown of positions on major county issues would go a long way in making his campaign more transparent and accessible to the public—particularly for those who can’t 
                attend bi-weekly breakfasts or don’t travel in political circles.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, Albrecht currently receives a rating that falls between average and above average for transparency and accessibility.

              <p>          

                Douglas Albrecht is a Republican incumbent running for his third term as a Cumberland County Commissioner. With a background in business and public service, 
                Albrecht emphasizes fiscal responsibility and common-sense solutions to the county’s long-standing issues. A lifelong Vineland resident and small business 
                owner, he holds degrees in Political Science, Economics, and an MBA.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout his time in office, Albrecht has served on key committees and acted as liaison to the Library Board, Board of Elections, Bayshore Council, and 
                Recreation Committee. He has helped lead a major renovation of the Cumberland County Library and has pushed for the creation of a countywide parks system. 
                His recent work includes budget oversight on the Finance Committee and voicing concerns over state-imposed election changes and environmental regulations that 
                he believes disproportionately affect the region.
                <br>
                <br>
                In recent speeches, Albrecht has criticized past Democratic-led projects like the now-abandoned county jail construction, citing mismanagement and lack of 
                contractual oversight that left taxpayers with millions in sunk costs. He’s also taken a firm stance against closing the juvenile detention center and has 
                noted the GOP’s success in avoiding tax increases over the past two years.
                <br>
                <br>
                Albrecht sees improving literacy, health, and household income as essential to lifting Cumberland County from its low rankings statewide, and he believes 
                these problems require practical leadership and transparent management.
