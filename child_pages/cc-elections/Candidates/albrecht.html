              <h6 class="page-title">Douglas Albrecht</h6>
              <p>          

                Doug Albrecht is seeking his third term on the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners, bringing years of business experience, economic 
                training, and institutional knowledge to the role. A fiscal conservative, he has helped hold the line on county taxes for three consecutive 
                years while supporting projects aimed at improving Cumberland’s historically low rankings in health, literacy, and household income.
                <br>
                <br>
                His 2025 agenda continues to emphasize budget discipline, targeted economic growth, and practical infrastructure upgrades. Key priorities 
                include advancing the Nabb Avenue Extension to boost commercial development, completing the stalled Middle Mile broadband network to expand 
                rural internet access, and overseeing responsible use of county facilities and capital projects—including the future of the county jail site. 
                As liaison to the Cumberland County Library, he has also championed the largest renovation in four decades, expanding community programs and 
                tech access.
                <br>
                <br>
                Albrecht’s positions reflect a blend of local problem-solving and cautious long-term planning—favoring shared services over tax hikes, 
                incentives over eminent domain, and modernization without abandoning core services. While recent changes to GOP breakfast meetings have 
                reduced one avenue for public access, his willingness to engage in extended interviews has given voters a detailed look at his record and 
                plans well ahead of November.

              <h6 class="page-title">Douglas Albrecht</h6>
              <p>          
                Douglas Albrecht is the longest-serving member of the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners and remains one of the most accessible 
                elected officials in the county. He attends GOP breakfasts, engages at public events, and has made himself available for multiple 
                long-form interviews, including two hour-long radio discussions with InformTheVoteNJ. In those settings, he has gone well beyond surface 
                talking points—explaining the details, challenges, and trade-offs behind major county projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                In a county where the press has largely collapsed, that willingness to sit down and talk is more than many candidates offer. But it also 
                raises the question: what would transparency look like if the status quo truly expected it? If voters could count on every candidate having 
                a clear, detailed campaign site, or on there being an annual candidate forum that wasn’t a guessing game announced by chance, or on local 
                press coverage that didn’t require someone like me to constantly chase people down with a camera and a mic? Like, perhaps monthly press 
                conferences could compliment the Republicans only breakfasts, where a lot of what is discussed is simply a political update, not 
                proprietary strategy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Albrecht gives the sense that if such a system existed, he would participate fully. The groundwork is already there—he’s publicly engaged, 
                has deep institutional knowledge, and is comfortable answering difficult questions. A truly comprehensive process might only require an 
                additional couple of hours on his part: planning a two-hour podcast, jotting down thoughts on the full range of county issues, and letting 
                someone else distill it into a written format for voters. That’s not a heavy lift for a candidate who already puts in significant work for 
                the county. And remember, this is coming from the perspective of the goal of this site: find a way to put all the info in one place so voters 
                don't have to go on a scavenger hunt.
                <br>
                <br>
                As it stands, Albrecht is doing more than many of his peers to make himself available. But the reality is that Cumberland County voters 
                would benefit from an environment where that level of engagement wasn’t exceptional—it was expected. Until then, his consistent accessibility 
                and willingness to engage earn him an above-average transparency rating, with room to set a new standard if the political culture evolves to 
                match his capacity.

            <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
              <p>In this 55-minute radio interview, Commissioner Doug Albrecht joins InformTheVoteNJ.com's Steven Solof for a wide-ranging conversation about his re-election campaign, the current state of county affairs, and long-term priorities. Although the Cumberland County Regular Republican Organization provides a platform bio outlining some of Albrecht’s stances, he does not have a dedicated campaign website. This interview is intended to go deeper—giving voters a chance to hear him explain his work in his own words.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility and Measurable Results:</strong><br>
              Albrecht discusses key strategies like holding the line on taxes for three consecutive years while highlighting improvements in public health rankings and infrastructure upgrades across the county.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Modernization and Emergency Response:</strong><br>
              The conversation touches on efforts to stabilize core county functions, expand broadband access in rural areas, and respond to public emergencies effectively. Projects like the Middle Mile fiber initiative and South Ave Culvert are explored in detail.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Transparency and Public Communication:</strong><br>
              Steven introduces the idea of a quarterly report to help bridge the information gap between elected officials and residents. Albrecht agrees this could improve public understanding and address the challenge of under-communicated government work.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Civic Engagement and Education:</strong><br>
              Albrecht emphasizes the importance of teaching local civics in schools, instilling a deeper sense of pride in community participation and awareness of how county government impacts daily life.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
              Whether you're lightly engaged or ready to go down the rabbit hole, this interview offers a rare, direct window into the mindset and leadership style of one of Cumberland County’s long-serving commissioners. It's a valuable listen for anyone curious about what’s being done—and what could still be improved—in county government.</p>

          <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
              <p>In this one-hour WVLT radio interview, I sat down with Cumberland County Commissioner Doug Albrecht, who is running for re-election in 2025. We unpacked everything from the future of the county jail and the controversial “concrete slab” to broadband expansion, library renovations, and navigating state red tape.</p>

              <p>Doug was candid throughout — even apologizing multiple times for not being able to cover everything — which underscores a larger point: these conversations take time. Each bullet point on a campaign site represents a whole story about priorities, constraints, and trade-offs.</p>

              <p>If you’re a Cumberland County voter trying to “do your homework,” this is the kind of long-form discussion that brings slogans to life — and helps you decide whether you agree with the leadership direction or want to see a change.</p>

                  <summary style="color: blue;"><strong>Literacy & Library Revitalization</strong></summary>
                  <p>
                    As liaison to the Cumberland County Library Board, Commissioner Doug Albrecht has championed literacy as a cornerstone of community 
                    development. Under his leadership, the county completed its most significant library renovation in over four decades—transforming the 
                    facility into a modern, multi-purpose resource center. Albrecht sees the library not just as a place for books, but as a hub for 
                    lifelong learning, digital access, and family-friendly programming.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Renovations included moving the children’s section to a safer, lower level; upgrading security and layout for ease of use; expanding 
                    access to technology including laptops and digital media; and creating flexible spaces for teens, small-group activities, and adult 
                    education programs. The library now hosts hundreds of events each year—from GED prep and computer literacy to yoga and cultural 
                    programming—ensuring that residents of all ages have pathways to engagement and learning.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Albrecht also supports plans for a new accessible playground, Jake’s Park, located directly in front of the library. The park will 
                    feature outdoor story panels that tie into literacy-themed programming, encouraging families to interact with the library during 
                    playtime. Construction is expected to begin in late 2025.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    In the longer term, Albrecht had pursued a grant-funded satellite library and visitor center in Maurice River Township to serve 
                    outlying communities with no school libraries and few public resources. While that grant was unexpectedly rescinded, he continues 
                    to advocate for the project, believing it could boost literacy and create a much-needed civic space in the southern part of the 
                    county. He remains committed to the idea that modern libraries can serve as community anchors—supporting education, workforce 
                    development, and civic engagement.

                <summary style="color: blue;"><strong>Health Outcomes and County Services</strong></summary> 
                <p> Commissioner Doug Albrecht acknowledges that Cumberland County has consistently ranked last among New Jersey’s 21 counties in terms of 
                  health outcomes. He says this has been a long-standing concern and one of the reasons he originally ran for office. While no sudden 
                  turnaround has occurred, Albrecht cites a slight shift—from 21st to 20th—in county health rankings during his early tenure as Freeholder
                   Director as a sign that some forward movement may be possible when resources are applied wisely. He’s careful not to overstate this 
                   shift, describing it as a small sign that “maybe we did something right.” 
                </p> 
                <br>
                <p> Albrecht connects this potential progress to broader fiscal and staffing reforms, such as finalizing union contracts that had gone 
                  unresolved and improving conditions at the county jail. He argues that supporting public employees and retaining experienced staff—including 
                  in health and safety-related positions—can lead to more stable and effective service delivery. 
                </p> 
                <br>
                <p> He also emphasizes the importance of inter-municipal cooperation and emergency preparedness as part of overall public well-being. 
                  Examples include the Sheriff’s Office temporarily assisting local police departments and municipalities lending emergency vehicles in times 
                  of crisis. Albrecht sees this as evidence that county-level coordination contributes to resilience, which plays a role in public health 
                  and safety.

                <details> <summary style="color: blue;"><strong>Income Per Household and Economic Stability</strong></summary> 
                  <p> Commissioner Doug Albrecht frames Cumberland County’s consistently low ranking in income per household as a reflection of deeper 
                    structural challenges. Rather than treating income as an isolated statistic, he views it as the result of broader dysfunction—issues 
                    like inadequate staffing in county government, slow project management, and missed economic opportunities. He argues that these 
                    inefficiencies have made it harder to attract and retain businesses and residents, which in turn affects household income levels 
                    across the region. 
                  </p> 
                  <br>
                  <p> Albrecht’s approach to improving income levels involves modernizing county operations and increasing overall capacity. He notes that 
                    prior to his tenure as Freeholder Director, the county was slow to execute even basic capital improvement projects, such as paving 
                    parking lots or completing building repairs. His administration pushed to complete these overdue tasks and bring on project management 
                    support, laying the groundwork for larger investments. 
                  </p> 
                  <br>
                  <p> One area he emphasizes is retaining institutional knowledge by treating county employees better—particularly those in skilled or 
                    hard-to-replace roles. By settling multiple union contracts and improving morale, Albrecht believes the county is better positioned 
                    to serve the public efficiently and compete for outside funding. 
                  </p> 
                  <br>
                  <p> He also points to efforts to bring in federal and state funding for infrastructure and development—such as the Middle Mile broadband 
                    project and public safety upgrades—as part of a longer-term strategy to make Cumberland County a more viable place for job growth. 
                    These steps, he argues, are beginning to show results: the county has reportedly gained $1 billion in ratables and lowered its tax rate 
                    by five cents, which he sees as a sign of growing fiscal health. In his view, raising household income requires strengthening the 
                    foundational services and systems that make economic development possible in the first place. </p>

                <details> <summary style="color: blue;"><strong>Government Efficiency and Institutional Reform</strong></summary> 
                  <p> Throughout his interviews, Commissioner Doug Albrecht has consistently returned to the idea that Cumberland County’s core problems—low 
                    income per household, last-place health rankings, and sluggish infrastructure progress—stem in part from inefficiencies within local 
                    government. He cites outdated systems, delayed projects, and unresolved labor contracts as symptoms of a government that had lost 
                    momentum prior to his tenure. 
                  </p> 
                  <br>
                  <p> During his time as Freeholder Director, Albrecht says he made it a priority to "unclog the pipes," finalizing 7 of 8 union contracts, 
                    addressing long-overdue capital improvements, and bringing in project management support to improve follow-through on basic infrastructure 
                    work. He believes these changes are necessary not only to fix obvious problems, but to regain public trust and demonstrate that the 
                    county is capable of handling larger initiatives responsibly. 
                  </p> 
                  <br>
                  <p> He also frames staff retention and institutional memory as key to government efficiency. Instead of cutting costs through austerity, 
                    he supports offering fair wages and professional stability so that experienced public employees remain in their roles, reducing turnover 
                    and training delays. 
                  </p> 
                  <br>
                  <p> Albrecht has also highlighted examples of inter-agency cooperation—such as the Sheriff’s Office supporting local police departments 
                    during coverage shortages and Bridgeton lending fire equipment to Millville—as models of how local government can operate more 
                    efficiently when it works as a unified team. 
                  </p> 
                  <br>
                  <p> While not presented under a formal "government reform" agenda, Albrecht's approach emphasizes internal capacity-building, reduced 
                    bureaucratic drag, and improved coordination between departments and municipalities as core tools for restoring public confidence and 
                    delivering results. </p>

                      <p>
                          This long-delayed Bridgeton culvert rebuild continues to highlight broader infrastructure and permitting issues in Cumberland County. Commissioner Doug Albrecht explained 
                          in a recent interview that although funding, planning, and contractor coordination are complete, the project remains stuck in limbo due to state and federal red tape. 
                          Specifically, <strong>seven separate permits</strong> are required—including from the Coast Guard and Historic Preservation—due to remnants of an old railroad in the area.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                          Albrecht sees this as a textbook example of bureaucratic inefficiency, where expert-approved plans can be delayed indefinitely by a single desk in Trenton or Washington. 
                          He recalled the culvert collapsing two years before Democrats took control of the board and emphasized that the County has done its part—only to be stalled by overlapping 
                          and often contradictory requirements from the New Jersey DEP and other agencies.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                          He also connected the issue to broader problems with state zoning and planning decisions, arguing that local governments often have little say in how infrastructure fits 
                          into community development. He described the DEP as operating more like a “hammer than a carrot,” issuing top-down mandates without local input or accountability.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                          Albrecht expressed optimism that Jack Ciattarelli’s proposed reforms to the DEP—shifting it toward a more responsive, rule-based agency—could directly help Cumberland 
                          County. If elected, Ciattarelli has stated he wants the DEP to act more like a regulatory body that reacts to real problems (like illegal dumping), rather than a 
                          policy-making authority that creates delays by constantly shifting requirements.

                      <p>
                        The **Middle Mile project** was originally designed to install a high-capacity fiber-optic backbone across Cumberland and Salem 
                        Counties, enabling local providers to build out last-mile internet to underserved rural areas. Commissioner Doug Albrecht continues 
                        to defend the initiative as a missed opportunity for Cumberland—not only to modernize broadband access but to **generate revenue** 
                        for the county by leasing fiber lines to private providers.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        Albrecht clarified in a recent interview that Salem County has now taken the lead, after Cumberland’s Board declined to prioritize 
                        the project. Salem secured over $20 million in BEAD (Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment) funding, and plans to extend 
                        last-mile service based on the assumption that the Middle Mile infrastructure will still move forward.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        Albrecht disputes the narrative that the project would have been too costly. He explained that Cumberland’s original commitment 
                        was estimated at $3.2 million, a figure that could have been covered through a mix of in-kind contributions—such as public safety 
                        towers from the County’s 700 MHz system—and strategic budgeting. He also argued that early cost estimates were inflated, and the 
                        County could have broken even or profited over time through line-leasing agreements.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        Despite limited support from his colleagues, Albrecht still sees Middle Mile broadband as a modern utility—essential for attracting 
                        data centers, remote work opportunities, and educational equity. Though disappointed that Cumberland stepped back, he remains 
                        hopeful that Salem’s leadership will eventually bring the project full circle and deliver benefits to the broader region.

                  <p>
                    Cumberland County’s long-troubled jail system has entered a new phase of transformation. Commissioner Doug Albrecht outlined 
                    how the county is now pursuing a regional partnership with Camden County after a failed attempt to create a joint facility with 
                    Salem and Gloucester. He framed the Camden deal as the most <strong>viable option currently on the table</strong>—one that would 
                    reduce travel and overtime costs, improve workforce conditions, and allow Cumberland to share long-term operational expenses with 
                    neighboring counties.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    In the short term, Albrecht says the deal would let Cumberland transfer inmates to Camden without the logistical nightmare of 
                    midnight pickups in Hudson County, where many inmates are currently housed. In the long term, Camden is planning a multi-county 
                    complex where Cumberland would have a vote in key decisions and staffing roles for its officers. Albrecht stressed that his main 
                    concern is making sure Cumberland’s correctional staff and inmate needs are treated fairly under any future arrangement.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    The failed Salem project left behind a controversial <strong>$16 million concrete slab</strong> and roughly <strong>$60 million 
                    in bonded funds</strong>. Albrecht explained that while the slab can’t support a jail, it may still serve as the foundation for 
                    a consolidated government building. This would bring scattered departments under one roof—improving efficiency, eliminating lease 
                    costs, and making better use of existing infrastructure like water, sewer, and HVAC systems already installed on site.
                  </p>
                  <br>

                    Albrecht emphasized that the bonded funds are not lost—they’re still collecting interest and could be redirected to meet urgent 
                    space and staffing needs in the county. He’s also advocated for practical renovations to the existing jail, including HVAC upgrades, 
                    door repairs, and general maintenance, to ensure safer working conditions while the long-term solution develops.

                    <p> Albrecht has voiced support for expanding the county’s library system into underserved areas, particularly 
                      Maurice River Township. He explains that during his tenure, the county had plans to build a satellite library in the township—not 
                      just as a traditional library, but as a hybrid facility that would include restrooms and serve as a small tourism and community hub 
                      near the coastal region. 
                    </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p> Albrecht says the proposed facility would have helped address both practical and educational gaps. 
                        The area lacks basic amenities for visitors, and nearby schools in Maurice River and Commercial Township reportedly have no school 
                        libraries. In his view, this project would have been a way to improve literacy rates and educational access while also encouraging 
                        civic engagement and small-scale economic development. He highlights that some local businesses had even begun purchasing or improving 
                        property in anticipation of the project’s impact.

                    <br>
                    <p> While the plan had initial state support and a grant was awarded, Albrecht says the funding was unexpectedly pulled by the state a year 
                      early—despite what he believes was a realistic path to completion. He attributes part of the delay to time-consuming environmental 
                      reviews and other procedural hurdles but remains committed to revisiting the project when circumstances allow. He frames the library 
                      not just as a place for books, but as a potential community anchor, similar to the fire halls and township buildings that already 
                      serve as informal gathering spaces in rural parts of the county.

                    <p> Albrecht has prioritized the Nabb Avenue Extension project as one of the most important long-term economic 
                      development efforts in Cumberland County. The goal is to create a direct connection between Route 55 and Route 49, unlocking access 
                      to the Millville Airport, industrial sites, farmland, and recreational areas on the western side of the Maurice River. 
                    </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p> Albrecht says the project was originally proposed in a 2012 Millville planning report but languished until he revived it during his 
                      time as Freeholder Director. He worked with the City of Millville and a key private landowner to design a route through a single 
                      property, choosing negotiation over eminent domain. The property owner ultimately agreed, aided by infrastructure incentives like 
                      erosion control, water flow improvements, and an overpass to maintain farm access. 
                    </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p> The proposed road includes a roundabout and would help facilitate increased industrial and recreational traffic throughout Millville, 
                      Fairfield Township, Commercial Township, and Port Elizabeth. Albrecht agreed with the description "a cornucopia of economic potential,” 
                      citing increased property values, job growth, and business expansion as expected outcomes. 
                    </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p> He also notes that the City of Millville has supported the project by investing in its industrial park and securing a PILOT 
                      agreement (Payment in Lieu of Taxes) to attract new business, with additional expansion phases contingent on the road’s completion. 
                    </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p> While the engineering and planning phases are complete, the project is currently stalled due to the loss of federal earmarks that 
                      had been proposed in both the House and Senate. Albrecht says these were pulled during budget reconciliation processes, setting the 
                      county back temporarily. However, he maintains that the county is committed to the project and will continue to push for completion as 
                      funds become available.
