              <h6 class="page-title">Douglas Albrecht</h6>
              <p>          

                Doug Albrecht is the longest-serving member of the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners and one of two Republican incumbents running unopposed in the 2025 
                primary. His longstanding experience and familiarity with county operations make him a key figure in ongoing policy conversations—from budget negotiations to 
                infrastructure projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Recently, Albrecht distinguished himself by participating in a one-hour radio interview with InformTheVoteNJ, offering substantive answers on complex county matters 
                such as the Nabb Avenue Extension and the Middle Mile Broadband initiative. Rather than relying on vague talking points, Albrecht addressed direct and sometimes 
                uncomfortable questions with a level of candor that many voters rarely get to hear—especially from candidates not facing primary opposition. His willingness to 
                participate in that format, and this early in the election cycle, reflects a notable commitment to transparency.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the same time, it's worth acknowledging a shift in one of the more consistent venues for Republican visibility: the bi-weekly GOP breakfasts. During my process 
                for nearly two years, these gatherings operated as semi-formal, civic-minded meetings open to Democrats, independents, and members of the press. But following public 
                critique of transparency issues in a local race, it was recently announced that press and Democrats would no longer be welcome. While the meetings still serve as a 
                regular touchpoint for Republican insiders, this change narrows public access to candidates like Albrecht—making direct interviews and open forums even more 
                important for reaching a broader audience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Despite that shift, Albrecht has taken initiative. In a political environment where many campaigns remain vague or inaccessible, his participation in a long-form 
                discussion helped unlock clarity on long-standing county projects and challenges. Voters may still have questions—but at least with Albrecht, they’re getting 
                real answers early on with plenty of time until November to make the full picture clear.

              <h6 class="page-title">Douglas Albrecht</h6>
              <p>          

                Douglas Albrecht is a two-term incumbent seeking a third term on the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners. He remains highly visible—attending GOP breakfasts, 
                engaging at county events, and hosting a weekly radio show. His Republican Party bio mentions involvement in issues like public health, literacy, income inequality, 
                taxation, and tourism, as well as infrastructure projects like the county park system.
                <br><br>
                On Monday 5/10, we did a radio interview on his weekly show to have an extended discussion to clarify his campaign messaging. 
                This is a significant positive step, though one limited by the format and timing.
                <br><br>
                Albrecht stands apart from less engaged candidates through his regular presence and willingness to acknowledge real problems. 
                <br><br>
                Given his access, experience, and community presence, Albrecht is well-positioned to not only offer a fully informed reelection case, he is uniquely positioned to help 
                inform the public at large what is going on in county-level politics because it is our understanding that he is the longest serving commissioner. That knowledge could help 
                voters cut through potential noise and help make meaningfully informed voting choices. 
                At present, he receives an “above average” transparency rating, with the potential to reach the top tier by simply putting the extent of his knowledge out there 
                so the county can clearly look it over when the general election comes in November.

              <p>          

                Douglas Albrecht is a Republican incumbent running for his third term as a Cumberland County Commissioner. With a background in business and public service, 
                Albrecht emphasizes fiscal responsibility and common-sense solutions to the county’s long-standing issues. A lifelong Vineland resident and small business 
                owner, he holds degrees in Political Science, Economics, and an MBA.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout his time in office, Albrecht has served on key committees and acted as liaison to the Library Board, Board of Elections, Bayshore Council, and 
                Recreation Committee. He has helped lead a major renovation of the Cumberland County Library and has pushed for the creation of a countywide parks system. 
                His recent work includes budget oversight on the Finance Committee and voicing concerns over state-imposed election changes and environmental regulations that 
                he believes disproportionately affect the region.
                <br>
                <br>
                In recent speeches, Albrecht has criticized past Democratic-led projects like the now-abandoned county jail construction, citing mismanagement and lack of 
                contractual oversight that left taxpayers with millions in sunk costs. He’s also taken a firm stance against closing the juvenile detention center and has 
                noted the GOP’s success in avoiding tax increases over the past two years.
                <br>
                <br>
                Albrecht sees improving literacy, health, and household income as essential to lifting Cumberland County from its low rankings statewide, and he believes 
                these problems require practical leadership and transparent management.

            <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
              <p>In this 55-minute radio interview, Commissioner Doug Albrecht joins InformTheVoteNJ.com's Steven Solof for a wide-ranging conversation about his re-election campaign, the current state of county affairs, and long-term priorities. Although the Cumberland County Regular Republican Organization provides a platform bio outlining some of Albrecht’s stances, he does not have a dedicated campaign website. This interview is intended to go deeper—giving voters a chance to hear him explain his work in his own words.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Fiscal Responsibility and Measurable Results:</strong><br>
              Albrecht discusses key strategies like holding the line on taxes for three consecutive years while highlighting improvements in public health rankings and infrastructure upgrades across the county.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Modernization and Emergency Response:</strong><br>
              The conversation touches on efforts to stabilize core county functions, expand broadband access in rural areas, and respond to public emergencies effectively. Projects like the Middle Mile fiber initiative and South Ave Culvert are explored in detail.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Transparency and Public Communication:</strong><br>
              Steven introduces the idea of a quarterly report to help bridge the information gap between elected officials and residents. Albrecht agrees this could improve public understanding and address the challenge of under-communicated government work.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Civic Engagement and Education:</strong><br>
              Albrecht emphasizes the importance of teaching local civics in schools, instilling a deeper sense of pride in community participation and awareness of how county government impacts daily life.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
              Whether you're lightly engaged or ready to go down the rabbit hole, this interview offers a rare, direct window into the mindset and leadership style of one of Cumberland County’s long-serving commissioners. It's a valuable listen for anyone curious about what’s being done—and what could still be improved—in county government.</p>
