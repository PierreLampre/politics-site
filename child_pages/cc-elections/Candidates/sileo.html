              <h6 class="page-title">Joe Sileo</h6>
              <p>
                Commissioner Director Sileo is up for re-election this year. Being that he is an incumbent and one of his challengers Capizola has less than one year of experience as a 
                commissioner, he has more experience than his democrat challengers. Like his ticket-mate Commissioner Romero, Sileo has a long career in business, specifically within the steel 
                industry. He has pointed out at a recent Republican breakfast that his business experience is important because many decisions of the Commissioner board are more 
                business-related decisions as opposed to political decisions. He has also been involved in several community leadership positions throughout the years. This was also 
                highlighted at the breakfast meeting as he pointed out that being Director Commissioner, he is now the leader and spokesperson of the board. Like most candidates at the local
                level, Sileo seems to be running slate (as part of the overall republican team) and there is little forward facing information about how 
                he is directly different from his democrat challengers. Generally speaking though, the local Republican party has mentioned several times that the county has been predominantly 
                controlled by the Democrats for the past 40 odd years, making a mess during that tenure (which is further suggested by recent articles claiming some of our towns are the worst 
                to live in the state), so perhaps it is time for Republicans to be in charge for a while so they can clean up the mess. He has been reached out to via his government email to 
                clarify his individual stances and how he differentiates 
                himself from his opponents, with no response. However, he also did point out at the breakfast meeting that with the current 7-0 Republican board, productivity has been much more 
                efficient since there are now significantly less political roadblocks, with the commissioner board being all on the same page.

        <div class="agenda-thesis can-sec">
            To be clear, with the lack of a proper newspaper providing thorough, professional-level election coverage, both sides of the aisle in *local* 
            politics seem to be suffering from a lack of clear messaging. This is not to say that they aren't putting forward a lot of effort to message, 
            but the information is oftentimes scattered across the internet, spoken about at meetings/events that appear partisan or have expensive 
            sponsorship fees, or mentioned at lengthy meetings most people simply won't attend. Oftentimes people get brief literature like
            <details>
                <summary style="cursor:pointer; color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">View Screenshot</summary>
                        <p>If on desktop, right click the image and select 'open in new tab' for a larger image</p>

            </details>
            . They also might get vague impressions of what local Republicans or Democrats might believe based on what they know about national politics.
            While we have been able to gather some specific information about Sileo's run for County Commissioner, as shown by the information above, there is probably a lot more 
            detail that we could go into about the specifics of the clerk's office and Sileo's campaign bid.
            <br>
            <br>
            The one general point that the party has made clear regarding the local level, is that the Democrat party has been predominantly in control for 
            the past 40 odd years, and they have made a mess while doing so, so perhaps it is time to let the Republicans take control for a while so they 
            can clean it up.
