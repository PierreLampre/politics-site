              <p>          

                LaRae Smith is a community-focused leader with a background in education, faith-based outreach, and public service in Commercial Township. She has served on the local Board 
                of Education, chaired the township’s Land Use Board and Democratic Committee, and has been recognized for her advocacy on economic development and family-oriented programming.
                In prior campaigns and interviews, Smith emphasized bringing a working-class voice to the table, strengthening youth outreach through faith-based partnerships, and 
                ensuring smaller municipalities have a seat in county-level decision-making.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, Smith’s current campaign is not visible to the public. Her previous website is no longer active, and there have been no updates to her policy platform or clear 
                communication about her current goals for the county. Despite past efforts to connect with voters and elevate underserved communities, there is no accessible messaging or 
                material available for the 2025 race.
                <br>
                <br>
                At this point, voters can only reference past interviews and public forums, which may not fully represent her current priorities or positions.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s also worth noting that although this is technically a primary race, two seats are open and only three Democrats are running—meaning there is a decent chance Smith will advance
                to the general election. In that context, voters would reasonably expect the candidates to offer more robust platforms, direct comparisons to 
                their likely opponents, and clear messaging on well-known county issues.

              <h6 class="page-title">Larae Smith</h6>
              <p>          

                LaRae Smith is no newcomer to public service. She’s served on the Commercial Township Board of Education, chairs both the township’s Democratic Committee and Land Use Board, 
                and has experience in community education, faith-based outreach, and economic development. Her previous campaigns and interviews revealed a passionate advocate for small-town 
                representation, youth engagement, and the importance of faith-based community support structures.
                <br>
                <br>
                Which makes it all the more surprising that there is no accessible campaign messaging available for her current 2025 race. Her campaign website from a prior run is no longer 
                active, no updated policy positions have been released, and she has not responded to outreach for participation in this year’s election coverage. Without a new campaign site, 
                recent interviews, or public events, voters have no way of knowing whether her current run builds upon her previous campaign promises or diverges from them.
                <br>
                <br>
                Smith’s past messaging emphasized the importance of transparency, showing up for community conversations, and bringing a working-class voice to leadership. She has spoken 
                compellingly in forums and interviews about using faith-based programs to address youth development, crime prevention, and poverty. But without a 2025 campaign update, it’s 
                difficult to assess whether these priorities still drive her platform.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s especially important for candidates with prior grassroots momentum to maintain visibility and follow-through. Smith previously earned significant voter support from a 
                small municipality, showing she can mobilize a local base. But continuing that momentum in 2025 requires clear communication—especially in an election where other candidates 
                are just a few miles away and still not presenting coherent public messaging.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, this rating can easily improve. All candidates, including Smith, are encouraged to raise their transparency score by completing a public questionnaire, publishing 
                a simple website or platform summary, or participating in an interview. The point isn’t to spotlight individuals—it’s to centralize and share information voters deserve to 
                have.
                <br>
                <br>
                If candidates truly believe in community engagement, then informing that community should be the baseline, not the afterthought. In 2025, the burden should not fall on voters 
                to guess where their local leaders stand.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, LaRae Smith currently receives a very low rating for transparency and accessibility.

        <h4 class="sub-heading">Agenda and Campaign Message</h4>
        
            <div class="experience can-sec">
                <p>As a Cumberland County resident for over 40 years, I understand the unique challenges and needs that face our communities. I also know that many people feel they 
                    have been ignored. Each person is important and deserves a representative that will support and fight for them during these uncertain times.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <p>We have a lot of work to do to win back the trust and confidence of our residents. I am ready to do the work needed to rebuild that trust by listening to what our 
                    voters say they need and expect from their representatives.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>A – Transparent Government</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I will work to improve the governing system so that meetings, discourse, and procedures are based on transparency and inclusion. It’s important that plans and 
                    decisions are publicized, giving residents the opportunity to observe, participate, and provide input—regardless of their economic or professional background.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Currently, transparency is lacking in how the commissioners conduct county business. The era of backroom deals must end, as it has only bred mistrust and resentment. 
                    I propose making commissioner meetings more accessible, including rotating meeting locations throughout the county and creating a monthly open podcast for public 
                    questions and updates.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>B – Family, Childcare, and Senior Services</h3>
                <p>With potential federal funding cuts on the horizon, I will prioritize developing alternative plans and partnerships to preserve vital services for families, 
                    children, seniors, and veterans. This includes seeking support from state leaders and corporations to fill funding gaps and maintain lifeline programs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>C – Veterans Services</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Our veterans deserve dependable support. In response to proposed cuts at the federal level, I will work on a local plan to sustain services and seek new funding 
                    through strategic partnerships with public officials and private entities. This ensures veterans retain access to the care and programs they depend on.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>D – Education</h3>
                <br>
                <p>With the potential elimination of the Department of Education, counties will need to step up. I will advocate for increased funding and local solutions to support 
                    affected education programs. Additionally, I will help schools address learning gaps caused by the pandemic by promoting new study models that enhance reading and 
                    math proficiency.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>E – Public Transportation</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I aim to expand existing public transportation routes to underserved areas—especially in southern and eastern Cumberland County—so residents can reliably travel to 
                    work, school, medical appointments, training, and essential services.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>G – Homelessness (Youth, Seniors, Veterans)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Cumberland County is facing a growing homelessness crisis. The influx of unhoused individuals from other parts of the state has overwhelmed local services, 
                    particularly healthcare and emergency care systems. I propose a coordinated plan that includes:</p>
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborating with healthcare and mental health professionals to assess and address root causes.</li>
                    <li>Developing partnerships with neighboring counties to return individuals to their home regions when appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Creating more local walk-in centers and shelters offering meals, safe housing, medical attention, and counseling.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring access to substance abuse and mental health services as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation strategy.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                    School, Smith spoke about her leadership in economic development and education.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When asked about how she would deal with poverty, homelessness, and substance abuse, Smith spoke about leveraging the

                        To note: A "general discussion point" is a summarized part of the video that might not have come from a direct question and 
                        answer format, but part of a tangent or general discussion.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1. Host: Tell us who you are.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Smith: I was born and grew up in Bridgeton. I went to Stockton State. After school, I stayed close to home so I could 
                        make an impact in my community, stay close to my family, and stay involved in my activities (class president in high 
                        school, varsity sports, girl scouts, basketball leagues). That was the right move for me and has led me to running for 
                        county commissioner. I have been consistently running for leadership positions, where I wound up on the Commercial 
                        Township Board of Education. I can be a voice for the smaller districts in the county. I can also provide a common 
                        sense voice for the community, as a lot of decisions are made behind closed doors, ‘the big boys situation’. I want to 
                        bring the voice of the middle and lower class residents.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2. Host: What made you realize you wanted to run for commissioner?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Smith: Coming from the small municipality of Commercial Township, I first ran and lost. Then I was reached out to by 
                        Donna Pearson (current Democrat commissioner) and Nancy Sungenis (former democrat party organizer). They were surprised 
                        that coming from a small municipality that I was able to get so many votes and lose by just a hair. At that point the 
                        light bulb went off regarding “Why not me?”, when I’m already doing a lot of community work, so why not get the title 
                        and do more? Our community needs more people who want to get their hands dirty and do the work of sitting in the 
                        meetings, having the discussions, and holding people accountable. The democrat party needed people who weren’t afraid 
                        to put their name on the ballot and be interviewed. Dr. Perella, John Capizola, and myself are out in the streets 
                        talking to people, not just handing out literature. We’re listening and going to events.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        3. General discussion point (La Rae Smith): This is not necessarily about getting votes, it’s about people. It’s about doing good work to help the people. It’s about knocking on the doors and asking “Do you need some help? Do you need services?”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        General discussion point (the host): If you’re not getting involved with knowing who to vote for, can you complain? 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        General discussion point: We have to show our children that split second decisions have consequences, because our 
                        families and communities are setting the bad example that even if you do something wrong and go through the system, 
                        the children get the impression that it’s ok, without realizing that the consequences will follow them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        4. Host: How do we teach our children that life is not a game, but it’s full of consequences and that they should make 
                        good choices?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Smith: We used to have strong faith-based initiatives. We should bring recreational activities that are partnered with 
                        the faith-based organizations. They should be coordinated in a way that connects the kids from the school directly to
