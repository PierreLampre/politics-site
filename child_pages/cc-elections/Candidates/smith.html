              <p>          

                LaRae Smith remains a long-time Cumberland County resident with deep roots in education, public service, and faith-based community work. In the 2025 county commissioner race she 
                distinguished herself by publishing a full platform, granting long interviews, and maintaining a campaign website with event listings—becoming one of the most transparent and 
                proactive candidates that race.
                <br>
                <br>
                In her current run for a seat on the Commercial Township Board of Education, the dynamics are different. A township school board is not the county commissioner’s office, and specifics 
                about this race still need to be clarified. As of this writing, Smith has not yet released new, race-specific materials to InformTheVoteNJ.com. However, compared to other 
                contenders she remains the only candidate who has been reachable and willing to engage in dialogue since outreach began this year.
                <br>
                <br>
                This contrast underscores her reputation for accessibility: even without formal campaign collateral in place, she continues to respond when asked for information. Voters will still 
                need clear issue positions tailored to this school board contest, but her track record suggests she may fill those gaps as the race progresses..

              <h6 class="page-title">Larae Smith</h6>
              <p>          

                During her 2025 county commissioner run, LaRae Smith set a high bar for transparency by corresponding directly with InformTheVoteNJ, sitting for a full-length interview, and 
                maintaining her own campaign website with an agenda and event listings. That track record still reflects positively on her today.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the current school board race, however, no new race-specific materials or updates have yet been provided to InformTheVoteNJ. While she remains the only candidate who has been 
                reachable and willing to engage in conversation since outreach began this year, voters do not yet have a clear, updated view of her priorities for this particular contest.
                <br>
                <br>
                Taken together, her past openness combined with limited new information places her a bit above average for transparency and accessibility at this stage—better than most of her peers 
                in responsiveness, but not yet at the level of fully proactive disclosure that she achieved in her commissioner campaign.

    <h4 class="sub-heading">Agenda and Campaign Message</h4>
        
            <div class="experience can-sec">
                <p>(Copy/pasted directly from correspondence with Larae)</p>
                <br>
                <p>As a Cumberland County resident for over 40 years, I understand the unique challenges and needs that face our communities. I also know that many people feel they 
                    have been ignored. Each person is important and deserves a representative that will support and fight for them during these uncertain times.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>We have a lot of work to do to win back the trust and confidence of our residents. I am ready to do the work needed to rebuild that trust by listening to what our 
                    voters say they need and expect from their representatives.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>A – Transparent Government</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I will work to improve the governing system so that meetings, discourse, and procedures are based on transparency and inclusion. It’s important that plans and 
                    decisions are publicized, giving residents the opportunity to observe, participate, and provide input—regardless of their economic or professional background.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Currently, transparency is lacking in how the commissioners conduct county business. The era of backroom deals must end, as it has only bred mistrust and resentment. 
                    I propose making commissioner meetings more accessible, including rotating meeting locations throughout the county and creating a monthly open podcast for public 
                    questions and updates.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>B – Family, Childcare, and Senior Services</h3>
                <p>With potential federal funding cuts on the horizon, I will prioritize developing alternative plans and partnerships to preserve vital services for families, 
                    children, seniors, and veterans. This includes seeking support from state leaders and corporations to fill funding gaps and maintain lifeline programs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>C – Veterans Services</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Our veterans deserve dependable support. In response to proposed cuts at the federal level, I will work on a local plan to sustain services and seek new funding 
                    through strategic partnerships with public officials and private entities. This ensures veterans retain access to the care and programs they depend on.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>D – Education</h3>
                <br>
                <p>With the potential elimination of the Department of Education, counties will need to step up. I will advocate for increased funding and local solutions to support 
                    affected education programs. Additionally, I will help schools address learning gaps caused by the pandemic by promoting new study models that enhance reading and 
                    math proficiency.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>E – Public Transportation</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I aim to expand existing public transportation routes to underserved areas—especially in southern and eastern Cumberland County—so residents can reliably travel to 
                    work, school, medical appointments, training, and essential services.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>G – Homelessness (Youth, Seniors, Veterans)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Cumberland County is facing a growing homelessness crisis. The influx of unhoused individuals from other parts of the state has overwhelmed local services, 
                    particularly healthcare and emergency care systems. I propose a coordinated plan that includes:</p>
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborating with healthcare and mental health professionals to assess and address root causes.</li>
                    <li>Developing partnerships with neighboring counties to return individuals to their home regions when appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Creating more local walk-in centers and shelters offering meals, safe housing, medical attention, and counseling.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring access to substance abuse and mental health services as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation strategy.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                    When asked about how she would deal with poverty, homelessness, and substance abuse, Smith spoke about leveraging the

                        <h4><strong>Summarized/Paraphrased Q&A</strong></h4>
                        To note: A "general discussion point" is a summarized part of the video that might not have come from a direct question and 
                        answer format, but part of a tangent or general discussion.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1. Host: Tell us who you are.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Smith: I was born and grew up in Bridgeton. I went to Stockton State. After school, I stayed close to home so I could 
                        make an impact in my community, stay close to my family, and stay involved in my activities (class president in high 
                        school, varsity sports, girl scouts, basketball leagues). That was the right move for me and has led me to running for 
                        county commissioner. I have been consistently running for leadership positions, where I wound up on the Commercial 
                        Township Board of Education. I can be a voice for the smaller districts in the county. I can also provide a common 
                        sense voice for the community, as a lot of decisions are made behind closed doors, ‘the big boys situation’. I want to 
                        bring the voice of the middle and lower class residents.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2. Host: What made you realize you wanted to run for commissioner?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Smith: Coming from the small municipality of Commercial Township, I first ran and lost. Then I was reached out to by 
                        Donna Pearson (current Democrat commissioner) and Nancy Sungenis (former democrat party organizer). They were surprised 
                        that coming from a small municipality that I was able to get so many votes and lose by just a hair. At that point the 
                        light bulb went off regarding “Why not me?”, when I’m already doing a lot of community work, so why not get the title 
                        and do more? Our community needs more people who want to get their hands dirty and do the work of sitting in the 
                        meetings, having the discussions, and holding people accountable. The democrat party needed people who weren’t afraid 
                        to put their name on the ballot and be interviewed. Dr. Perella, John Capizola, and myself are out in the streets 
                        talking to people, not just handing out literature. We’re listening and going to events.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        3. General discussion point (La Rae Smith): This is not necessarily about getting votes, it’s about people. It’s about doing good work to help the people. It’s about knocking on the doors and asking “Do you need some help? Do you need services?”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        General discussion point (the host): If you’re not getting involved with knowing who to vote for, can you complain? 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        General discussion point: We have to show our children that split second decisions have consequences, because our 
                        families and communities are setting the bad example that even if you do something wrong and go through the system, 
                        the children get the impression that it’s ok, without realizing that the consequences will follow them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        4. Host: How do we teach our children that life is not a game, but it’s full of consequences and that they should make 
                        good choices?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Smith: We used to have strong faith-based initiatives. We should bring recreational activities that are partnered with 
                        the faith-based organizations. They should be coordinated in a way that connects the kids from the school directly to 
                        after school activities and programming, which will help keep them out of the bad environments. They can also be used 
                        in conjunction with modeling programs, where kids can learn good behavior and decision making from good role-models.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        5. General discussion point: COVID exposed that we have been programmed to only go to work to keep a roof over our 
                        heads, and so we’ve left the parenting up to the schools. By the time we get home from work, we are too tired to do 
                        anything else. We’re not checking homework, and sometimes the kids aren’t even getting homework. It has gotten to the 
                        point where we are graduating kids who can’t even read.
