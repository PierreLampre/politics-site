              <p>          

                <!-- LaRae Smith is a long-time Cumberland County resident with a well-rounded background in education, public service, and faith-based community work. She has served on the 
                Commercial Township Board of Education, chaired the township’s Land Use Board and Democratic Committee, and earned recognition for her work in youth engagement, 
                family support services, and local economic development.
                <br>
                <br>
                Among the three Democrats running for two open commissioner seats, Smith has emerged as the most proactive in reaching voters. She has published a comprehensive 
                campaign platform focused on transparent governance, improved services for families and veterans, expanded public transportation, and efforts to address 
                homelessness. In addition, she recorded a full-length interview and maintains a campaign website with upcoming event listings—offering voters multiple ways to 
                learn about her background and positions.
                <br>
                <br>
                While Smith remains unendorsed by the county Democratic establishment, she has taken it upon herself to fill the gaps left by the party’s limited infrastructure. 
                As of now, the county party’s website still contains no event listings or visibility support for any of its candidates—endorsed or unendorsed. Smith isn’t 
                responsible for that institutional breakdown, but she has shown a willingness to rise above it and do the work independently.
                <br>
                <br>
                In a race where voter awareness remains low and basic candidate information is often hard to find, Smith’s transparency and consistency stand out. With two 
                seats available and only three Democratic contenders, she is in strong position to advance to the general election. Her continued outreach and follow-through will 
                be crucial in solidifying support, but so far, she has done more than most to earn the attention of engaged voters.

                <!-- Larae Smith has continued to improve her transparency and accessibility this election season by corresponding directly with InformTheVoteNJ, participating in a full-length 
                interview to discuss her background, agenda, and stance on key county issues, and publishing her own website that includes her agenda and campaign events. This level of 
                engagement demonstrates a clear commitment to informing voters. Throughout this campaign season she has gone from a relatively moderate visibility based on prior 
                campaign seasons, to a full level of transparency based on our reasonable standards. Well done Larae. -->

    <h4 class="sub-heading">Agenda and Campaign Message</h4>
        
            <div class="experience can-sec">
                <p>(Copy/pasted directly from correspondence with Larae)</p>
                <br>
                <p>As a Cumberland County resident for over 40 years, I understand the unique challenges and needs that face our communities. I also know that many people feel they 
                    have been ignored. Each person is important and deserves a representative that will support and fight for them during these uncertain times.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>We have a lot of work to do to win back the trust and confidence of our residents. I am ready to do the work needed to rebuild that trust by listening to what our 
                    voters say they need and expect from their representatives.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3>A – Transparent Government</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I will work to improve the governing system so that meetings, discourse, and procedures are based on transparency and inclusion. It’s important that plans and 
                    decisions are publicized, giving residents the opportunity to observe, participate, and provide input—regardless of their economic or professional background.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Currently, transparency is lacking in how the commissioners conduct county business. The era of backroom deals must end, as it has only bred mistrust and resentment. 
                    I propose making commissioner meetings more accessible, including rotating meeting locations throughout the county and creating a monthly open podcast for public 
                    questions and updates.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>B – Family, Childcare, and Senior Services</h3>
                <p>With potential federal funding cuts on the horizon, I will prioritize developing alternative plans and partnerships to preserve vital services for families, 
                    children, seniors, and veterans. This includes seeking support from state leaders and corporations to fill funding gaps and maintain lifeline programs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>C – Veterans Services</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Our veterans deserve dependable support. In response to proposed cuts at the federal level, I will work on a local plan to sustain services and seek new funding 
                    through strategic partnerships with public officials and private entities. This ensures veterans retain access to the care and programs they depend on.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>D – Education</h3>
                <br>
                <p>With the potential elimination of the Department of Education, counties will need to step up. I will advocate for increased funding and local solutions to support 
                    affected education programs. Additionally, I will help schools address learning gaps caused by the pandemic by promoting new study models that enhance reading and 
                    math proficiency.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>E – Public Transportation</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I aim to expand existing public transportation routes to underserved areas—especially in southern and eastern Cumberland County—so residents can reliably travel to 
                    work, school, medical appointments, training, and essential services.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h3>G – Homelessness (Youth, Seniors, Veterans)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Cumberland County is facing a growing homelessness crisis. The influx of unhoused individuals from other parts of the state has overwhelmed local services, 
                    particularly healthcare and emergency care systems. I propose a coordinated plan that includes:</p>
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborating with healthcare and mental health professionals to assess and address root causes.</li>
                    <li>Developing partnerships with neighboring counties to return individuals to their home regions when appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Creating more local walk-in centers and shelters offering meals, safe housing, medical attention, and counseling.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring access to substance abuse and mental health services as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation strategy.</li>
                </ul>

                        <br>
                        1. Host: Tell us who you are.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Smith: I was born and grew up in Bridgeton. I went to Stockton State. After school, I stayed close to home so I could 
                        make an impact in my community, stay close to my family, and stay involved in my activities (class president in high 
                        school, varsity sports, girl scouts, basketball leagues). That was the right move for me and has led me to running for 
                        county commissioner. I have been consistently running for leadership positions, where I wound up on the Commercial 
                        Township Board of Education. I can be a voice for the smaller districts in the county. I can also provide a common 
                        sense voice for the community, as a lot of decisions are made behind closed doors, ‘the big boys situation’. I want to 
                        bring the voice of the middle and lower class residents.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2. Host: What made you realize you wanted to run for commissioner?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Smith: Coming from the small municipality of Commercial Township, I first ran and lost. Then I was reached out to by 
                        Donna Pearson (current Democrat commissioner) and Nancy Sungenis (former democrat party organizer). They were surprised 
                        that coming from a small municipality that I was able to get so many votes and lose by just a hair. At that point the 
                        light bulb went off regarding “Why not me?”, when I’m already doing a lot of community work, so why not get the title 
                        and do more? Our community needs more people who want to get their hands dirty and do the work of sitting in the 
                        meetings, having the discussions, and holding people accountable. The democrat party needed people who weren’t afraid 
                        to put their name on the ballot and be interviewed. Dr. Perella, John Capizola, and myself are out in the streets 
                        talking to people, not just handing out literature. We’re listening and going to events.

                        3. General discussion point (La Rae Smith): This is not necessarily about getting votes, it’s about people. It’s about doing good work to help the people. It’s about knocking on the doors and asking “Do you need some help? Do you need services?”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        General discussion point (the host): If you’re not getting involved with knowing who to vote for, can you complain?

                        <br>
                        General discussion point: We have to show our children that split second decisions have consequences, because our 
                        families and communities are setting the bad example that even if you do something wrong and go through the system, 
                        the children get the impression that it’s ok, without realizing that the consequences will follow them.

                        <br>
                        4. Host: How do we teach our children that life is not a game, but it’s full of consequences and that they should make 
                        good choices?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Smith: We used to have strong faith-based initiatives. We should bring recreational activities that are partnered with 
                        the faith-based organizations. They should be coordinated in a way that connects the kids from the school directly to 
                        after school activities and programming, which will help keep them out of the bad environments. They can also be used 
                        in conjunction with modeling programs, where kids can learn good behavior and decision making from good role-models.

                        <br>
                        5. General discussion point: COVID exposed that we have been programmed to only go to work to keep a roof over our 
                        heads, and so we’ve left the parenting up to the schools. By the time we get home from work, we are too tired to do 
                        anything else. We’re not checking homework, and sometimes the kids aren’t even getting homework. It has gotten to the 
                        point where we are graduating kids who can’t even read.
