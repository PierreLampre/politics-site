                When asked what makes her the most qualified candidate for Commissioner at the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High 
                School, Smith spoke about her leadership in economic development and education.

                <br>
                When asked about how she would deal with poverty, homelessness, and substance abuse, Smith spoke about leveraging the 
                faith based organizations and community outreach programs.

                Inform the Vote would like to note that Smith left the Candidates Forum approximately halfway through for an official 
                public duty (maybe School Board, but we're not sure).

                    <h4><strong>Summarized/Paraphrased Q&A</strong></h4>
                    To note: A "general discussion point" is a summarized part of the video that might not have come from a direct question and 
                    answer format, but part of a tangent or general discussion.

                    1. Host: Tell us who you are.

                    Smith: I was born and grew up in Bridgeton. I went to Stockton State. After school, I stayed close to home so I could 
                    make an impact in my community, stay close to my family, and stay involved in my activities (class president in high 
                    school, varsity sports, girl scouts, basketball leagues). That was the right move for me and has led me to running for 
                    county commissioner. I have been consistently running for leadership positions, where I wound up on the Commercial 
                    Township Board of Education. I can be a voice for the smaller districts in the county. I can also provide a common 
                    sense voice for the community, as a lot of decisions are made behind closed doors, ‘the big boys situation’. I want to 
                    bring the voice of the middle and lower class residents.

                    2. Host: What made you realize you wanted to run for commissioner?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Smith: Coming from the small municipality of Commercial Township, I first ran and lost. Then I was reached out to by 
                    Donna Pearson (current Democrat commissioner) and Nancy Sungenis (former democrat party organizer). They were surprised 
                    that coming from a small municipality that I was able to get so many votes and lose by just a hair. At that point the 
                    light bulb went off regarding “Why not me?”, when I’m already doing a lot of community work, so why not get the title 
                    and do more? Our community needs more people who want to get their hands dirty and do the work of sitting in the 
                    meetings, having the discussions, and holding people accountable. The democrat party needed people who weren’t afraid 
                    to put their name on the ballot and be interviewed. Dr. Perella, John Capizola, and myself are out in the streets 
                    talking to people, not just handing out literature. We’re listening and going to events.

                    3. General discussion point (La Rae Smith): This is not necessarily about getting votes, it’s about people. It’s about doing good work to help the people. It’s about knocking on the doors and asking “Do you need some help? Do you need services?”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    General discussion point (the host): If you’re not getting involved with knowing who to vote for, can you complain? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    General discussion point: We have to show our children that split second decisions have consequences, because our 
                    families and communities are setting the bad example that even if you do something wrong and go through the system, 
                    the children get the impression that it’s ok, without realizing that the consequences will follow them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. Host: How do we teach our children that life is not a game, but it’s full of consequences and that they should make 
                    good choices?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Smith: We used to have strong faith-based initiatives. We should bring recreational activities that are partnered with 
                    the faith-based organizations. They should be coordinated in a way that connects the kids from the school directly to 
                    after school activities and programming, which will help keep them out of the bad environments. They can also be used 
                    in conjunction with modeling programs, where kids can learn good behavior and decision making from good role-models.

                    5. General discussion point: COVID exposed that we have been programmed to only go to work to keep a roof over our 
                    heads, and so we’ve left the parenting up to the schools. By the time we get home from work, we are too tired to do 
                    anything else. We’re not checking homework, and sometimes the kids aren’t even getting homework. It has gotten to the 
                    point where we are graduating kids who can’t even read.
