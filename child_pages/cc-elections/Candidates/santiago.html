                <p>
                Francisco Santiago Jr. is running for the Vineland School Board. A 23+ year educator and administrator with deep experience
                in Special Education and Multilingual Learner (ML) programs, he currently serves as Supervisor of Special Education and
                Multilingual Learners (K–12). His platform centers on improving educational quality across ability and language groups,
                building community partnerships for career readiness, modernizing curriculum, and increasing transparency with families
                and staff. 
                <br><br>
                Santiago highlights hands-on leadership: launching Community-Based Instruction (CBI) and Work-Based Learning (WBL) programs,
                creating school–business partnerships, and founding Project PIEDRA to support displaced Puerto Rican families after Hurricane
                Maria. He frames his outlook as student-first, equity-driven, and solutions-focused.

                <p>
                Relative to the Cumberland County status quo, Santiago’s initial submission is <strong>above average</strong>.
                He provided structured content covering background, agenda pillars, specific issue approaches, and an ideological
                orientation tailored to a nonpartisan school race. 
                <br><br>
                The submission is a good starting point towards substantive information on Special Education and Multilingual Learners, and seeds concrete approaches
                to partnerships and readiness (CBI/WBL). We plan to unpack those ideas in an upcoming interview. With these steps and a few more like scheduled meet n greets, social media 
                updates, and a campaign site,
                Francisco is on pace to present a fully transparent campaign.

                        how communicative they've been in response to outreach, see the rating and its short explanation. This helps you understand what’s easy to find and who is easy to

                        If you 'just want the facts', stick to the source documents. If you want opinions about transparency, accessibility, and communication, check the transparency meter. 
                        If you want coverage somewhere in between, like interviews that range from introductory to moderately pressing, watch the interviews. Choose your own adventure.</li>
