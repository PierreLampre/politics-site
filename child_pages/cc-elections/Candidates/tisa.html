                Incumbent John Tisa is a familiar face in Lawrence Township, with regular attendance at Republican events and a record of public service. Longtime residents may already have a 
                sense of his values and approach, and his continued involvement suggests a genuine commitment to the role. That said, for newer residents, younger voters, and independents 
                hoping to fairly compare both candidates, there’s currently a lack of accessible, campaign-specific information. With no public website, no policy outline, and minimal 
                participation in broader outreach efforts, Tisa falls short of modern transparency standards—not due to absence, but due to an outdated communication model. A few intentional 
                steps—such as a published platform and participation in a public candidates forum—would make his candidacy much more accessible to today’s voter expectations.

              <h6 class="page-title">John Tisa</h6>
              <p>          

                John Tisa is the incumbent candidate for Lawrence Township Committee and is currently seeking reelection. As a sitting official, Tisa benefits from the built-in visibility 
                that comes with public office—he attends township meetings, participates in votes, and interacts regularly with local officials. In theory, this should make him one of the 
                most transparent figures on the ballot.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, the utility of that default transparency depends on whether the information is well maintained and easily accessible. Without a centralized campaign site, many voters 
                that don't regularly pay attention may have no idea about his platform, and those that do might only have scattered impressions about where he stands on specific issues. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For example, with our interactions with Lawrence Township, it has become clear that there is an issue with maintaining the township site, especially with meeting minutes.
                Tisa has said that he is in the process of working on that, but we wouldn't have known that without attending the bi-weekly Republican breakfasts, and we don't know what 
                the current status of those efforts are. In other words, how is the average voter supposed to know any of this when reviewing their choices near elections?
                <br>
                <br>
                Tisa does attend Republican breakfasts frequently, has placed lawn signs, and has at least one known meet-and-greet scheduled—but that event was only discoverable through 
                partisan word-of-mouth, not any formal public-facing campaign effort that we're aware of.
                <br>
                <br>
                He has:
                <ul>
                    <li>No campaign website</li>
                    <li>Not responded to information requests</li>
                    <li>Not identified or clarified where he stands on key local issues
                    </li>
                    <li>Offered no formal messaging beyond casual comments at breakfast events</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <br>
                This isn't just about checking boxes—it’s about recognizing that voters like those following InformTheVoteNJ are actively seeking information and coming up empty because 
                candidates like Tisa haven’t prioritized outreach beyond the party structure, at least to our knowledge. If the overall county infrastructure for public information were 
                stronger, perhaps these communication gaps would be less noticeable. But in the absence of a robust county-wide PR system, candidates bear more responsibility to close the 
                loop themselves.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, John Tisa receives a below-average to average transparency rating. He’s not completely absent—but his approach remains rooted in a status quo that no longer meets 
                the public’s expectations for open, accessible, and voter-focused communication in the modern, fast-paced, tech-based culture.
                <br>
                <br>
                A campaign website, clear policy statements, and participation in a candidate forum would quickly elevate him to a much more favorable transparency tier—and would help 
                voters understand what he’s done, where he stands, and how he plans to handle his potential tenure moving forward.
