              <p>
                Candidate Bashaw is a self-described 'outsider' running in the Republican primary for US Senate. 
                While he says he is an outsider, he does have a lot of well-documented leadership awards for serving in politically related roles. He also has 
                a lot of experience as a successful businessman in real estate and hospitality. He seems to have decided to jump directly into politics in 
                response to the government's handling of COVID and how it affected small businesses. He wants to secure the border while revamping legal 
                immigration policy to encourage legal immigration. While Inform the Vote has only briefly spoken to Bashaw, he has been hitting the campaign 
                trail hard, which is well documented on Twitter/X. When asked directly about differentiating himself from the other primary candidates, Bashaw spoke about 
                how he won the most counties to get on the primary ballot, and his team has the strongest resources to beat the likely democrat opponent Andy Kim in the 
                general election. He also addressed rumors about him being a RINO, a 'republican in name only', and he said that he has been a republican his whole life, 
                only maybe endorsing democrats about 20 percent of the time when he felt it was appropriate.

              While Mr. Bashaw may not have been directly involved in up to this point, he has been around politics his whole life. 
              His grandfather had a political radio show that the government shut down, and so his grandfather rented a boat to 
              take his show off the coast and out of the jurisdiction so he could continue to broadcast. His grandfather also had 
              a strong conviction that political discussions ought to be based in listening and persuasion rather than telling people
              exactly what to think or censoring unfavorable views.
