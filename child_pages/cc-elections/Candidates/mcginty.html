                As of 7/8/2025, we still don't have any information on this candidate. As a reminder, we reach out through information obtained through whichever clerk's office 
                is appropriate, basic google searches, and public comments at appropriate governmental meetings. In other words, a lack of information on this site should not be 
                perceived as a lack of effort on our part, we simply haven't received anything yet.

                <p><strong>Why he lands here:</strong><br>
                Right out of the gate, Thomas McGinty answered my questionnaire, had already completed a 2.5-hour podcast interview, and quickly booked a full radio hour 
                through my platform. From those touchpoints alone, I can form a solid picture of his background (geologist / hazardous-site mitigation), overall vision 
                (remediation & redevelopment), an actionable agenda (Wheaton/brownfields, public safety, code enforcement), and early stances on key issues. That’s more 
                engagement and usable substance than I typically get at this stage from first-time or lesser-known candidates.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Context that matters:</strong><br>
                We’re reaching a point where the gap between “average,” “above average,” and “top-tier” is shaped as much by the Cumberland County status quo as by any one 
                candidate’s effort. If campaigns rarely advertise meet-and-greets or fair appearances, there’s less to attend. If there’s no standard candidate forum or 
                debate at the school board/city/county levels, no one can show up for it. And if winning candidates routinely skip publishing clear issue pages or agendas, 
                it’s unrealistic to expect new contenders to roll out state-level, fully sourced platforms on day one.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><strong>What would move McGinty to “Top-Tier” transparency here:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-top:0;">
                    <li><strong>Central hub:</strong> Publish a clean campaign site with résumé, <em>issue-by-issue</em> pages, and concise summaries linked to source materials (reports, ordinances, statutes, data).</li>
                    <li><strong>Public calendar:</strong> Proactively post upcoming appearances (forums, meet-and-greets, radio/podcasts) and archive past events with links/clips.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open Q&amp;A:</strong> Participate in any neutral forum offered; if none exists, host a basic town-hall/Q&amp;A and accept neutral moderation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document the record:</strong> Keep a page of questionnaires answered, interviews completed, and one-page stance summaries (downloadable PDF for voters).</li>
                    <li><strong>Specifics &amp; follow-through:</strong> Translate themes into timelines/metrics (e.g., Wheaton/brownfield milestones, blight/code-enforcement benchmarks, youth-program partners).</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact &amp; response norms:</strong> Publish contact methods and typical response windows; consider office hours.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><strong>What could slide him back toward “Average”:</strong><br>
                If the initial burst of access fades, if action plans on youth/safety/blight remain vague, or if there’s no central, updated hub for voters to track positions 
                and appearances, the rating would likely settle closer to the county norm.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong><br>
                McGinty currently clears the local bar for transparency and accessibility—decisively. He’s engaging, available, and substantive enough for voters to understand 
                who he is and what he wants to do. He’s not yet at the polished, deeply sourced standard you might see from statewide figures (think Steven Fulop or Andy Kim), 
                but with a public calendar, an issue hub, and measurable follow-through, he could get there.</p>

            <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
                <p>In this extended podcast interview, Thomas McGinty—candidate for Millville City Commissioner—speaks with Red Advertising about his background, leadership style, and practical vision for Millville. Drawing on decades as a geologist and environmental regulator, along with frontline experience as a corrections officer, McGinty frames himself as a “nuts and bolts” problem-solver focused on safety, cleanup, and redevelopment.</p>

                <p><strong>Industrial Roots & Redevelopment Readiness:</strong><br>
                McGinty ties Millville’s past to its future: from Wheaton Glass and heavy industry to modern redevelopment opportunities. He emphasizes hazardous site remediation, rail and gas access, and the possibility of data-center or industrial reuse—especially at the Wheaton property—as the engine to restore ratables and attract employers.</p>

                <p><strong>Public Safety, Addiction, & Accountability:</strong><br>
                He repeatedly returns to safety as the precondition for growth—supporting more officers and stronger prosecutorial follow-through. Addiction and homelessness are described as cyclical, statewide problems that require services <em>and</em> clear accountability to reduce crime and improve quality of life.</p>

                <p><strong>Maurice River & Underused Tourism Assets:</strong><br>
                McGinty argues Millville has a tourism backbone hiding in plain sight—birding, fishing, and eco-tourism along the Maurice River and open spaces. With cleanup and basic order, he believes these assets can meaningfully contribute to downtown recovery.</p>

                <p><strong>Leadership Philosophy:</strong><br>
                He calls for “gutsy” leadership that stops recycling failed approaches, prioritizes teamwork, and tells the truth about what’s not working. He respects the current mayor’s energy but says he’s better suited to be a hands-on commissioner focused on operations and results.</p>

                <p><strong>Personal Resilience & Service:</strong><br>
                From Eagle Scout lessons to mentoring youth projects—and even while battling cancer—McGinty underscores lifelong learning, civic duty, and a willingness to “call things out” when necessary. He wants Millville treated like an investment worth fighting for, not a political prize.</p>

                <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
                If you want a substantive, ground-level case for how cleanup, safety, and infrastructure can restore Millville’s economy, this conversation provides a clear look at McGinty’s priorities and the experience he believes will help deliver them.</p>

                <p>A focused conversation with <strong>Thomas McGinty</strong>, candidate for the Millville City Commission. <em>Note:</em> the first ~15–20 minutes did not record; the video picks up mid-conversation.</p>

                <p><strong>Team-First Governing:</strong><br>
                McGinty emphasizes a cohesive commission focused on solving big problems—not bickering or “stepping-stone” politics.</p>

                <p><strong>Remediation &amp; Redevelopment:</strong><br>
                Drawing on his background as a geologist and hazardous site mitigation specialist, he outlines how to convert contaminated properties into brownfield-ready industrial sites—especially <strong>Wheaton Glass</strong>—and then complete the administrative push to match sites with tenants.</p>

                <p><strong>Case Study (EPA CAMU):</strong><br>
                He describes cutting through years of paralysis on a hazardous site by coordinating DEP/EPA and stakeholders, overcoming objections, and delivering a remedy that enabled warehouse use and on-site solar.</p>

                <p><strong>Public Safety &amp; City Image:</strong><br>
                Funding exists to hire additional officers; recruitment and coordination are the bottlenecks. He supports visible <em>walking patrols</em> and a stronger city image to aid recruitment.</p>

                <p><strong>Blight, Youth, and Services:</strong><br>
                Calls for aggressive code enforcement and open bidding (no inflated “emergency” teardowns), leveraging Thunderbolts pride and grassroots youth programs, and getting city staff back at desks with supervisor accountability.</p>

                <p><strong>Transparency:</strong><br>
                Pledges clear communication and collaboration without over-promising—guided by an Eagle Scout ethos.</p>
