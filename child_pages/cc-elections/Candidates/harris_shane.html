              <p>
                Candidate Harris is a retired Vineland Police Officer of 30 years whose policing experience has many direct ties to the local education sector. This gives him 
                a strong, informed perspective on how to address school safety and security moving forward in Vineland Public Schools. He hopes that by sustaining security in 
                schools, teachers and students will be able to focus on education rather than safety. He believes that current disciplinary methods are sufficient, but if 
                particular school buildings are having high numbers of incidents, they should be looked at specifically and handled on a case by case basis. For Parents Rights vs 
                Student Privacy, he will follow the law as written. And in terms of Student Performance, he plans to listen to the needs of administrators and teachers first, then 
                address them accordingly.

                Quoted directly from communication with Harris:
                <br>
                <br>
                As stated in my background information I am fully qualified to work with Security Issues.
                Bringing my past experience to the table would allow me to bring a unique perspective to
                the Board:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Obviously in this day and age security is of the utmost importance. At the school
                        level we need to implement plans that allow our children to feel safe in their
                        environment. A student's primary focus should be on learning.
                    <li>
                    <br>
                    <li>2. In order to sustain a safe environment policies need to be looked at, evaluated,
                        and updated yearly. This should be done as a collaboration with school and
                        district personnel. School personnel so they can give input as to what works
                        well in their individual building and what changes they feel are necessary. And
                        appropriate district personnel who would have been attending seminars with
                        agencies that have been involved in crisis situations.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>3. The Board Representative(s) should also have a panel meeting at least quarterly
                        with school personnel, District Security personnel and City Stakeholders
                        concerning security.
                    </li>
                </ul>                    
            </div>

            <div class="experience can-sec">
                Quoted directly from communication with Harris:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                      <li><b>Disciplinary Methods</b>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If there were too many incidents within the normal day at specific schools those
                            schools need to be addressed. The data from those schools need to be looked
                            at individually. From there plans can be developed to decrease the discipline
                            issues.
                            </li>
                            <li>Discipline should be handled on a case by case situation. Teachers and
                                Administrators working with parents and guidance staff can often change
                                behavior. Working together as a team can determine if behavior plans within the
                                school are appropriate or if other outside services are needed. In working as a
                                team to address discipline issues the student gets the support needed to change
                                the behavior and the teacher gets the support necessary to focus on academic
                                instruction with less disruption.
                            </li>
                        <Ul>
                      <li>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <li><b>Parents Rights vs. Students Privacy</b>
                          <br>
                          I believe in parents rights but I also believe in following the law. With my background of
                          thirty years of law enforcement my initial reaction to any issue would be to follow the law.
                      </li>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <li><b>Student Performance</b>
                      <br>
                      There are many factors that play into test scores and benchmarks. As a Board Member I would
                      like to hear from Administrators and teachers in terms of what they need in order for their
                      students to be more successful. Then as best we can meet those needs.
                      </li>

                Quoted directly from communication with Harris:
                <br>
                <br>
                Every candidate has their own personal reasons for running for the School Board and
                should be applauded. I would hope that I stand out above the rest for a few reasons.
                Being as a Grandfather of Vineland Public School students I have a vested interest in
                ensuring that our students receive the best possible education. Secondly as I stated
                before part of my tenure as a Vineland Police Officer was spent working in the schools.
                This gives me a unique background and solid foundation of safety and security of our
                schools.
