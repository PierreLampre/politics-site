              <h6 class="page-title">Joseph A. Miletta Jr.</h6>
              <p>
                Joseph Miletta has been in this position for 17 years while investing his time to help make township repairs, donating resources like steel to help
                help make those repairs, and donating to community resources like the fire company and rescue squad through fundraisers. 
                He prides himself on being active in his role, making sure to call everyone back who needs help from him, which his 
                predecessors did not necessarily do. His wife coordinates the Memorial Day parade for the township, which is one of the longest running 
                parades in the county. He also prides himself on being a working man who can relate to the needs of the constituents in his township. 
                He mentioned that the township only gets about 800,000 dollars in its budget, and he tries to spend it appropriately, but current laws force him to 
                return his surplusses, where he would prefer to keep them in the township coffers as a rainy day fund for emergencies. He says he has been a democrat 
                his whole life, but it is more of a label than a strict ideology for him, as he has been working across the aisle his whole political career. In terms, 
                of comparing himself to his opponent, he believes the opponent is a young guy who is gaining some traction on social media, but doesn't have the 
                experience to do the job with the same competence level as Miletta.

                With his township budget being relatively small, Miletta feels as though he shouldn't have to return budget surpluses back to the state, 
                as that money could be used as a rainy day fund for emergencies.

                Miletta is under the impression that his opponent is a young guy who is gaining traction on social media, but who probably has nowhere
                near the same level of experience as Miletta, which could leave one to question how effective his opponent would be.
