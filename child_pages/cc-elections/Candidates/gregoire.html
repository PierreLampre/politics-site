    <h6 class="page-title">Daniel Gregoire</h6>
    <p>
    Daniel Gregoire has lived in Millville since 2012 and brings 40+ years in water/wastewater systems, quality control, and field operations. He presents himself as a hands-on, 
    whole-systems problem-solver with leadership experience in the Knights of Columbus. His priorities: clean up the city and fix “first impressions,” hire an experienced economic 
    development lead (funded via grants/bonds), grow the ratable base, and use pragmatic incentives so Millville competes with neighboring towns. He links storefront blight, stray 
    shopping carts, panhandling, and homelessness to investor confidence and favors coordinated solutions with staffing, community partners, and a designated point person.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    He also calls for more road repairs (with clarity on street-opening funds), a regional strategy on illegal ATVs/dirt bikes, and stronger code enforcement—including moving abandoned 
    properties to rehab-minded owners. Internally, he argues the city is short-staffed and under-equipped; he’d seek grants (e.g., Clean Communities) for hires and a second street sweeper, 
    with city-wide sweeping and park/street care. On communication, he wants plain-English explanations of policy changes, follow-through on public comments, and a suggestion email/box; 
    for utilities, he prefers payment plans and tax-sale tools over shutting off water for families in hardship. His pitch: unite employees and residents, execute visibly, and make 
    Millville competitive again.

    <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
    <h6 class="page-title">Daniel Gregoire</h6>
    <p>
      Gregoire provided a combined written response and sat-down for an interview that clarified background and priorities—stronger engagement than 
      the local baseline. He outlines specific, testable ideas (hire an economic lead; city-wide sweeping; improve abandoned-property pipeline; 
      alternative paths to water-bill collection; suggestion box/email) and ties them to funding concepts (grants/bonds/Clean Communities).
      <br><br>

      To move toward a top-tier transparency rating, we’ll look for: (1) a centralized, consitently-updating web presence; (2) consistent public 
      availability (events, forums, long-form interviews); (3) concrete, time-bound plans/budgets for staffing/equipment; and (4) follow-through 
      on communications promises (e.g., documented responses to resident input). Also, with the recent plane banner at the Millville football game, it might be time to make an official ticket 
      announcement for Sooy, McGinty, and Gregoire. For now, the rating sits at <em>“Above Average 
        (trending upwards)”</em> based on responsiveness and clear themes laid out early.

                He also calls for more road repairs (with clarity on street-opening funds), a regional strategy on illegal ATVs/dirt bikes, and stronger code enforcement—including moving abandoned 
                properties to rehab-minded owners. Internally, he argues the city is short-staffed and under-equipped; he’d seek grants (e.g., Clean Communities) for hires and a second street sweeper, 
                with city-wide sweeping and park/street care. On communication, he wants plain-English explanations of policy changes, follow-through on public comments, and a suggestion email/box; 
                for utilities, he prefers payment plans and tax-sale tools over shutting off water for families in hardship. His pitch: unite employees and residents, execute visibly, and make 
                Millville competitive again.

      Gregoire provided a combined written response and sat-down for an interview that clarified background and priorities—stronger engagement than 
      the local baseline. He outlines specific, testable ideas (hire an economic lead; city-wide sweeping; improve abandoned-property pipeline; 
      alternative paths to water-bill collection; suggestion box/email) and ties them to funding concepts (grants/bonds/Clean Communities).
      <br><br>

      To move toward a top-tier transparency rating, we’ll look for: (1) a centralized, consitently-updating web presence; (2) consistent public 
      availability (events, forums, long-form interviews); (3) concrete, time-bound plans/budgets for staffing/equipment; and (4) follow-through 
      on communications promises (e.g., documented responses to resident input). Also, with the recent plane banner at the Millville football game, it might be time to make an official ticket 
      announcement for Sooy, McGinty, and Gregoire. For now, the rating sits at <em>“Above Average 
        (trending upwards)”</em> based on responsiveness and clear themes laid out early.

    <h4 class="sub-heading">Background and Campaign Message</h4>
    <div class="experience can-sec">
      Daniel Gregoire is French-Canadian and originally from the Chicago area. He attended Catholic high school, has some college, and then worked 
      as a welder before moving into water and wastewater management—his field for the last 41 years. He’s handled equipment builds, quality control, 
      and product specialization, with extensive time on the road. He says that whole-system view prepared him for the coordination and accountability 
      of city work, and notes that he helped replace city water/wastewater equipment in Millville following a walkthrough years ago. He’s also held 
      leadership roles across levels in the Knights of Columbus, which he describes as a governance-like organization with transferable leadership 
      lessons. A Millville resident since 2012, he characterizes himself as driven and diligent—pursuing problems until the job is done—and wants 
      Millville’s government and workforce aligned with residents to deliver visible results.
