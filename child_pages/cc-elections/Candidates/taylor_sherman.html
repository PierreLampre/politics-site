    <h4 class="quick-sum">quick summary</h4>
    <h6 class="page-title">Sherman R. Taylor</h6>
    <p>
      Sherman R. Taylor is a lifelong Millville resident (born 1970) with 38 years in emergency services, including work as an EMT, firefighter, Class I 
      Special Police Officer, Emergency Management Coordinator/Deputy, and Senior Public Safety Telecommunicator and Communications Training Officer for 
      Cumberland County 911 and the Millville Police Department. He retired from public safety dispatch in 2024. His family has deep local roots—his father 
      worked at Wheaton Glass for 50 years, his mother served as a controller for local auto dealers since 1955, and his grandparents operated Robbins Market 
      at 5th & Broad.
      <br><br>
      Taylor frames his candidacy around three themes—<em>Strength, Experience, Commitment</em>—with priorities that start with public safety staffing and 
      readiness: bringing the police department “back to full staff or better,” ensuring the fire department is appropriately staffed with firefighters and 
      EMTs, and improving recruitment/training pipelines. He argues this won’t change overnight due to hiring/training timelines but says reversing long-term 
      understaffing is essential.
      <br><br>
      Economically, he supports building Millville’s ratable base and positioning the city as “a hub for business and commerce,” which he believes requires 
      the “right economic development team.” He also emphasizes culture and communication: listening to residents, encouraging community involvement, and 
      restoring a sense of civic pride.
      <br><br>
      Taylor says he’s ready to “hit the ground running,” and, given his background, expresses interest in serving as Public Safety Director if assigned; 
      he notes he has working relationships with multiple department heads and could contribute in any seat under Millville’s commission form of government.

    <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
    <h6 class="page-title">Sherman R. Taylor</h6>
    <p>
      Initial transparency/accessibility view: <em>Developing</em>. Taylor has posted a substantive introductory statement outlining his background and top 
      priorities and has an active Facebook campaign page (see below). At this stage, we have not yet logged a dedicated campaign website, long-form 
      interviews, or a truly public facing campaign event. What that means is that there is an upcoming event with Taylor and two other candidates that is 
      technically a fundraiser, which limits voters and the press from hearing campaign messaging without directly supporting it. It also raises the question 
      of whether these 3 candidates are campaigning together without publicly saying so.
      <br><br>
      What would move this rating up: a central campaign site with organized agenda/issue pages; coordinated communication with the press; long-form 
      interviews (radio/podcast/video); and timely replies to voter/media inquiries. As those pieces appear, we’ll update the rating to reflect real-world 
      accessibility for voters. The main benefit for voters with this candidate and many others is to engage in the action plans that describe how his 
      campaign ideas will actually materialize if they get elected.

              Taylor’s top priority is staffing and readiness across police, fire, and EMS. He supports returning the police department to 
              “full staff or better,” ensuring the fire department is appropriately staffed with firefighters and EMTs, and improving recruitment, 
              training, and time-to-field given lengthy hiring pipelines.

      <p>
        "Hello everyone, my name is <strong>Sherman R. Taylor</strong> and I am running for Millville City Commission on November 4th, 2025 (Column E, Lever 2).
        I was born in Millville in 1970 and have lived here for 54 years. My parents, Sherman and Shirley, lived in Millville for over 80 years. My 
        father worked for Wheaton Glass for 50 years, and my mother served as a controller for several long-standing car dealerships beginning in 1955. 
        My maternal grandparents owned and operated Robbins Market at 5th and Broad for decades. I come from a hard-working family with deep roots in this 
        community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve given back to Millville my entire life—starting with cutting neighbors’ lawns as a kid to volunteering with emergency services. I know and 
        understand this community. I’m married to my wife Susan, a retired Millville Police officer. We have a son, Chuck, his wife Tina, and two grandsons. 
        I’m rooted here for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from Millville Senior High School in 1989. At the end of my sophomore year I began my emergency services journey as an EMT with the 
        Millville Rescue Squad. I was hooked, and I’ve spent the next 38 years serving Millville and Cumberland County as an EMT, firefighter, Class I 
        Special Police Officer, Emergency Management Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator, and for the last 33 years as a Senior Public Safety 
        Telecommunicator and Communications Training Officer for Cumberland County 911 and for the Millville Police Department (25 of those years), 
        before retiring in 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe I’m the best choice for Commission because I care deeply about where Millville has been, where it is now, and what it can become. I’ve seen 
        our city at its best and its worst. With hard work, cooperation, and commitment, we can make Millville the vibrant gem of Cumberland County again.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Priorities:</strong> First, public safety. We must bring our police department back to full staff (or better) and ensure the fire department 
        is properly staffed with firefighters and EMTs. Hiring and training take time, but we can rebuild. Second, economic development. We need ratables 
        to grow into a hub for business and commerce, and that takes the right economic development team. Finally, a renewed civic culture: listening to 
        residents, welcoming community input, and restoring pride in our city.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m ready to hit the ground running. My goal would be to serve as Public Safety Director if assigned because that’s where my heart and experience 
        are. I also understand other departments and, as a department head for over 15 years, have strong relationships with current leaders and can 
        contribute wherever I’m needed. With your support, I’ll serve to the best of my ability and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Slogan:</strong> <em>Strength, Experience, Commitment</em> for Millville. I will be a strong leader, I have the experience, and I am 
        committed to making Millville a safer, better place to live.
      </p>
