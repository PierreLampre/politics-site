              <p>          

                Carol Sabo is a Democratic candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly in Legislative District 1 and currently serves as Mayor of West 
                Cape May. With a background in social work, education, and local government, Sabo has built her career on community advocacy and public 
                service. She supports universal access to healthcare—including both physical and mental health—believing it should function as a public 
                service rather than a for-profit industry. A strong proponent of public education, she opposes school voucher programs and backs increased 
                investment in local schools. On energy, she advocates a balanced approach that includes continued fossil fuel use during a long-term 
                transition towards more renewables. Her housing agenda emphasizes both affordability and sustainability, including guaranteed housing for veterans 
                and expanded apartment development in underserved areas like Cape May County.
                <br>
                <br>
                While early campaign outreach and visibility were limited, Sabo recently participated in a detailed phone interview and expressed openness to 
                further engagement through radio and podcast formats. Her campaign messaging remains sparse online and she has not advertised public 
                appearances, but her willingness to begin engaging more directly with voters and the press marks a meaningful step in the right direction.

              <h6 class="page-title">Carol Sabo</h6>
              <p>          

                Carol Sabo is running for NJ General Assembly in Legislative District 1. While her campaign website provides a general overview of her 
                background and values, it currently offers limited detail on specific policies or legislative priorities. For much of the primary election cycle, 
                her campaign had lacked the standard infrastructure voters increasingly rely on—such as detailed online messaging, consistent email 
                responsiveness, or publicly advertised event appearances.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, a recent phone interview marked a meaningful step in the right direction. In that conversation, Sabo provided much more substantive 
                insight into her background, ideology, and issue-based priorities than what had previously been available. She also expressed a willingness 
                to continue engaging through future formats, including a potential appearance on our radio show and a longer-form podcast—both of which 
                indicate an encouraging openness to transparency.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, it’s important to note that this progress comes after weeks of outreach attempts and largely informal methods of contact. The absence 
                of a consistent communication pipeline—either for voters or the press—means that access to her campaign still depends heavily on persistence 
                and timing, rather than predictability or invitation. In that sense, Sabo's campaign remains in a gray area: more open than some, but still 
                lacking the public-facing structure needed to reliably reach and inform constituents.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, Sabo now receives an average rating for transparency and accessibility. This reflects meaningful improvement and a promising 
                attitude toward further engagement. If she follows through on her expressed willingness to participate in public forums and provide ongoing 
                issue-based clarity, she could easily reach a higher rating in the near future. This platform exists to support exactly that kind of 
                progress—for all candidates—by offering fair opportunities to engage the public and document their positions.

                    <strong>Quick Summary</strong>
                </summary>
                Carol Sabo is a Democratic candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly in Legislative District 1 and currently serves as Mayor of West 
                Cape May. With a background in social work, education, and local government, Sabo has built her career on community advocacy and public 
                service. She supports universal access to healthcare—including both physical and mental health—believing it should function as a public 
                service rather than a for-profit industry. A strong proponent of public education, she opposes school voucher programs and backs increased 
                investment in local schools. On energy, she advocates a balanced approach that includes continued fossil fuel use during a long-term 
                transition towards more renewables. Her housing agenda emphasizes both affordability and sustainability, including guaranteed housing for veterans 
                and expanded apartment development in underserved areas like Cape May County.
                <br>
                <br>
                While early campaign outreach and visibility were limited, Sabo recently participated in a detailed phone interview and expressed openness to 
                further engagement through radio and podcast formats. Her campaign messaging remains sparse online and she has not advertised public 
                appearances, but her willingness to begin engaging more directly with voters and the press marks a meaningful step in the right direction.

                <strong>Explanation</strong>
            </summary>
            Carol Sabo has moved decisively in the right direction. She completed a full hour on the InformTheVoteNJ Radio Hour (WVLT 92.1), giving voters a 
            clear, long-form look at her background and priorities. She’s also been visibly present across Cumberland County—showing up at multiple public 
            events—and she proactively tags InformTheVoteNJ on social media to flag where she’ll be, which meaningfully improves discoverability for 
            voters and press.
            <br>
            <br>
            These behaviors—long-form interviews, in-county presence, and proactive notice—push her above the typical baseline for transparency and 
            accessibility. They also signal a willingness to meet voters where they are, not just during peak campaign moments.
            <br>
            <br>
            The most room for improvement thus far, which is not specific to her, is to clearly advertise campaign events like meet n greets, town halls, etc 
            so that curious voters and the press know they will have a planned chance to meet and ask questions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall: Above Average today, with clear momentum. If the current cadence of appearances, advance notices, and substantive interviews 
            continues—and is paired with a simple, predictable information pipeline—Sabo is on track to reach Top-Tier.

                    <p>
                        On this episode of <em>InformTheVoteNJ Radio Hour</em> (Cruisin 92.1 WVLT), host Steven Solof sits down with
                        <strong>Carol Sabo</strong>, Mayor of West Cape May and candidate for New Jersey’s LD1 General Assembly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Carol shares her decades of experience in social work, advocacy, and municipal leadership, discusses key campaign
                        priorities like healthcare access, affordable housing, and public education, and explains why she’s running for higher office.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steven also offers his usual introductory report on campaign culture, voter timelines, and the need for more robust
                        candidate engagement in Cumberland County.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is an introductory conversation—a starting point for voters to get to know Carol Sabo and what she hopes to bring to Trenton.
