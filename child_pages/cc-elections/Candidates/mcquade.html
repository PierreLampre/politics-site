              <h6 class="page-title">Robert McQuade</h6>
              <p>
                Robert Mcquade has political experience from previously sitting on the Millville Board of Education for 9 years, he was a 
                Millville City Commissioner for about a year, and served on the Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office law enforcement advisory board. He co-founded the Center 
                City Crime Watch and has received many recognitions for his work in policing over the years. His agenda seems to be focused on increasing 
                community policing to address several known issues, leveraging strong coordination with county and state representatives to efficiently 
                solve problems, create a Community Relations Board so residents can identify and address issues with local government, and using a hands-on 
                approach with community organizations to directly address issues where government either cannot or moves too slowly.
                <br>
                <br>
                When googling McQuade, there is an article regarding being arrested several years ago.
                <a href="https://www.nj.com/cumberland/2019/03/school-board-member-charged-with-impersonating-a-police-officer-applies-for-pti.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="website-link">NJ dot com article</a>. 
                We spoke with McQuade about this incident and he thoroughly addressed it, which you can hear about in our interview below and read more about 
                in our media section at the bottom of this page.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Community Policing - Increase police presence throughout the community and have them establish 
                    a friendly connection to the public. By establishing a friendly, communicative relationship with 
                    residents, police can become more aware about what's going on with issues such as crime, homelessness, 
                    and road safety.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                    Strong Coordination with County and State Representatives - Oftentimes issues going on in the city are 
                    also related to county and state jurisdictions. By maintaining strong relationships with representatives 
                    who handle different jurisdictions, problem solving will be more efficient.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                    Create a Citizens Community Board - In prior terms, McQuade had been involved with boards that invited 
                    members of the city to help identify issues, suggest methods for addressing those issues, and prioritize 
                    the issue. If elected, McQuade intends to establish such a board in Millville to help constituents feel 
                    heard and engaged.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li> 
                    Hands-On Approach With the Community - Oftentimes governments cannot be directly involved with particular 
                    issues for legal reasons, or the government based solutions can move slowly. McQuade intends to address 
                    problems directly as a citizen when appropriate, and to ask community organizations like churches to help 
                    directly address problems.

                <p>The below interview comprehensively goes through current issues that incumbent Ranello and current Vice-Mayor Sooy brought up to us. That list 
                of issues can be found <a href="../../../child_pages/cc-elections/millville_city_issues.html">here.</a>
                McQuade addresses them in his own words starting at about ____, and we have a bullet point summary of that below the video.</p>

                    <br>
                    <li>Homeless encampments - Create zoned areas where people can stay so it's contained. Coordinate with county and state representatives 
                    to figure out where homeless people are coming from, as sometimes they are bussed in from cities like Atlantic City. Establish humane treatment 
                    programs to help get the homeless back on their feet.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Economic development pros and cons - Keep commerical development to the designated areas such as the industrial parks. Coordinate 
                    with tourism areas like Cape May to help increase economic activity. Widen the junction at route 49 and route 47 to make traffic flows 
                    more appealing.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>Nabb Ave Extension and it's alleged slow-moving pace - Coordinate with state and national reps like Senator Testa and Congressman 
                    Van Drew to see why it is moving slowly.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>City Salary Competitiveness - The city only has so much money to work with in it's budget, so bringing crime stats and low salaries to 
                    Trenton could help make the state more aware of the city's struggles, and thereby get the state to send more money to the city.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Road Safety and Off Road Vehicles - Police Chief Harvey had a system of using unmarked vehicles to observe and report similar problems 
                    in the past. Implementing a similar system could help address this current issue.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Water and Sewage Infrastructure in Laurel Lake - Wants to keep the current expansion methods moving forward while making sure 
                    residents have an opt-out method so they are not forced to participate.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>State Mandates vs Local Needs - Wants to have some known people who can act as negotiators between the state and city. This will help 
                    ensure the city is compliant without acting against it's own interests.</li>

                When doing research for our site, we usually google each candidates name to see what we can find, with varying results. When one google's 
                candidate McQuade, an article regarding an arrest comes up, which makes it seem as though McQuade was arrested for being involved in a 
                bar fight. However, as per our interview with McQuade, it seems as though a fight broke out when he arrived to pick up a friend from the bar, 
                and McQuade, a special police officer with many certifications and recognitions in the community, went to perform a citizens arrest on someone 
                involved in the fight. He wanted us to share documentation of his creditials and recognitions to help clarify the articles online:
