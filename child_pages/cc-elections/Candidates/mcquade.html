              <p>
                
                Robert McQuade is a dedicated community leader with extensive experience in public service. Having served on the Millville School Board for 
                nine years and as a City Commissioner for one year, McQuade brings a wealth of hands-on governance experience to his campaign.
                <br>
                <br>
                His platform focuses on improving Millville’s infrastructure, cleaning up streets, and addressing the city's ongoing police staffing shortages. 
                McQuade advocates for a more accessible government, emphasizing the importance of community engagement through initiatives like the Community 
                Relations Board and Millville Ambassadors.
                <br>
                <br>
                A strong proponent of economic development, McQuade is committed to boosting Millville’s economy through projects like the Nabb Ave road extension 
                and supporting local businesses. He also addresses social issues such as homelessness, advocating for better solutions like the M25 initiative 
                to provide housing for those in need.
                <br>
                <br>
                McQuade’s stance on cannabis sales is cautious; he stresses the importance of considering community input and proximity to schools before 
                making any decisions. With a focus on transparency, accessibility, and collaborative leadership, McQuade aims to foster a Millville that is 
                safer, more prosperous, and more connected to its citizens.

              <h6 class="page-title">Robert McQuade</h6>
              <p>          

                Robert McQuade has demonstrated a high level of transparency and accessibility throughout his campaign. He is consistently active in the 
                community, regularly attending commissioner meetings, engaging with residents, and providing direct answers to any questions. He has 
                participated in three interviews with InformTheVoteNJ.com, further showcasing his commitment to open communication and public dialogue.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, while McQuade’s personal engagement is exemplary, the state of local media in Cumberland County poses a significant challenge. In 
                2025, the collapse of local press and the rise of modern service expectations have elevated the standard for political candidates’ digital
                presence. McQuade's approach, while commendable, could benefit from a more robust and digestible digital presence, such as a dedicated campaign 
                website, that allows voters to easily access his platform and key messaging.
                <br>
                <br>
                Without a campaign site, McQuade's efforts to be visible and accessible come up short in today’s fast-paced information age. Voters expect to 
                be able to quickly research candidates and get their questions answered without having to dive deep into meetings and personal outreach. 
                If McQuade can leverage digital tools to streamline his messaging, he would be poised for top-tier transparency and accessibility in the 
                modern political landscape.

                            Robert McQuade has made significant strides in improving Millville’s streets and public spaces. He focused on cleaning up the streets, painting curbs, and clearing gutters, working directly with the Streets and Roads department. His hands-on approach includes collaborating with local workers and addressing their needs through Total Quality Management (TQM), a system that puts employees in charge of improving their daily tasks. This practical approach aims to create a cleaner, more welcoming city for all residents.

                        <p>
                            McQuade is also actively involved in cleaning up areas like railroad tracks and vacant lots, ensuring the city is maintained properly. His collaboration with community members, such as candidate David Summers, highlights his willingness to tackle these tasks head-on, even utilizing personal equipment to clear waste. McQuade's ongoing engagement in these projects demonstrates his commitment to not just talking about improvements, but actually making them happen.

                            McQuade emphasizes the importance of hands-on leadership and staying connected with the people. His approach is to be the "People’s Commissioner" by attending to the concerns of residents directly, not just through formal meetings. He recalls his childhood experience of receiving care and support from Millville's firefighters and police officers, which has shaped his desire to serve the city. McQuade wants to bring back that personal connection, ensuring the public has a voice in city decisions and that officials are always approachable.

McQuade also emphasizes the importance of face-to-face interactions over digital communication, as he believes it fosters a deeper connection with residents. His personal philosophy of leading by example and working directly with the public has earned him respect as a hands-on and accessible leader.

                        <p>
                            One of McQuade’s primary concerns is the police staffing shortage in Millville. He acknowledges that the city's police force has been understaffed for years, which has a direct impact on safety. He draws from his personal experience as a part-time officer to emphasize that even when there were around 85 officers, the department was still considered understaffed. McQuade believes that any number below that is inadequate to ensure public safety.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            To address this, McQuade suggests a two-fold approach: first, securing federal grants to help fund additional officers, and second, increasing the number of class one and class two officers—officers who are less costly but still provide valuable patrolling and law enforcement. He also calls for a shift back to foot and bike patrols, which he believes can enhance police visibility and community interaction, making it easier to spot potential issues before they escalate.

                        <p>
                            McQuade understands that Millville’s economic future is tied to its ability to grow its tax base. One of his key priorities is expanding industrial development, particularly through projects like the NAB road extension. This extension would provide a more efficient truck route to Millville’s industrial park and airport, reducing congestion in residential areas and encouraging further investment. McQuade sees the expansion as a vital step toward bringing more business and jobs to the area, which in turn will increase local revenue.

                        <p>
                            Beyond physical infrastructure, McQuade emphasizes that the city must find sustainable ways to generate revenue without overburdening its residents. He opposes raising taxes as a solution, instead focusing on bringing in more businesses and leveraging existing resources. For McQuade, the key to a stable economy is not only industrial growth but also creating a balanced and fair tax system that benefits everyone.

                        <p>
                            McQuade approaches the issue of cannabis sales with caution. While he supports medical cannabis for those in need, he expresses concern about the impact of recreational cannabis sales, particularly in relation to schools and neighborhoods. McQuade voted against a proposal to place a cannabis dispensary near a charter school on Weaten Avenue, citing the proximity to young children as a significant concern. He also raises the issue of cannabis sales in Millville, particularly in areas where the city has not yet decided on the appropriate zoning for dispensaries.

                            McQuade believes that the community’s opinion should be a major factor in determining where cannabis dispensaries are located. He advocates for listening to residents, local businesses, and other stakeholders before making decisions that could affect the entire city. McQuade’s cautious approach reflects his desire to balance economic growth with community safety and well-being.

                        <p>
                            McQuade is deeply critical of Millville’s current form of government under the Walsh Act, describing it as inefficient and outdated. He compares the commission system to a household where all members have equal power, making it difficult to get things done. Without a final decision-maker, important projects and decisions often stall. McQuade argues that switching to a mayor-led system would provide the leadership and clarity necessary for effective governance.

                            In his view, the Walsh Act system is a relic of the past and needs reform. He points to his experience on the city commission, where he worked with colleagues like Joe Suie to build consensus and address issues. However, he believes that to move Millville forward, the city needs a more decisive leadership structure, where a single individual can take responsibility for key decisions and drive the city’s progress.

                            McQuade’s commitment to improving public safety is evident in his deep concern for Millville’s police staffing crisis. He identifies the shortage as a major obstacle to effectively addressing crime, particularly in high-risk areas. His plan includes bringing in additional officers through federal grants, increasing class one and class two officers, and enhancing community policing through foot and bike patrols. By directly engaging with the community, McQuade believes the police force can regain the trust of residents and work more effectively to reduce crime.

            <ul>
                <li>Community Policing - Increase police presence throughout the community and have them establish a friendly connection to the public. By establishing a friendly, communicative relationship with residents, police can become more aware of issues such as crime, homelessness, and road safety.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Strong Coordination with County and State Representatives - Oftentimes issues going on in the city are also related to county and state jurisdictions. By maintaining strong relationships with representatives who handle different jurisdictions, problem-solving will be more efficient.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Create a Citizens Community Board - In prior terms, McQuade had been involved with boards that invited members of the city to help identify issues, suggest methods for addressing those issues, and prioritize them. If elected, McQuade intends to establish such a board in Millville to help constituents feel heard and engaged.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Hands-On Approach With the Community - McQuade intends to address problems directly as a citizen when appropriate and to ask community organizations like churches to help directly address problems.</li>

                <br>
                <li>Homeless encampments - Create zoned areas where people can stay so it's contained. Coordinate with county and state representatives to figure out where homeless people are coming from, as sometimes they are bussed in from cities like Atlantic City. Establish humane treatment programs to help get the homeless back on their feet.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Economic development pros and cons - Keep commercial development to the designated areas such as the industrial parks. Coordinate with tourism areas like Cape May to help increase economic activity. Widen the junction at Route 49 and Route 47 to make traffic flows more appealing.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Nabb Ave Extension and its alleged slow-moving pace - Coordinate with state and national reps like Senator Testa and Congressman Van Drew to see why it is moving slowly.</li>
                <br>
                <li>City Salary Competitiveness - The city only has so much money to work with in its budget, so bringing the issues of crime stats and low salaries to Trenton could help make the state more aware of the city's struggles, and thereby get the state to send more money to the city.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Road Safety and Off Road Vehicles - Police Chief Harvey had a system of using unmarked vehicles to observe and report similar problems in the past. Implementing a similar system could help address this current issue.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Water and Sewage Infrastructure in Laurel Lake - Wants to keep the current expansion methods moving forward while making sure residents have an opt-out method so they are not forced to participate.</li>

When one googles candidate McQuade, an article regarding an arrest comes up, which makes it seem as though McQuade was arrested for being involved in a bar fight. However, as per our interview with McQuade, it seems as though a fight broke out when he arrived to pick up a friend from the bar, and McQuade, a special police officer with many certifications and recognitions in the community, went to perform a citizen's arrest on someone involved in the fight. He wanted us to share documentation of his credentials and recognitions to help clarify the articles online:</p>
