              <p>
                Robert Mcquade has political experience from previously sitting on the Millville Board of Education for 9 years, he was a 
                Millville City Commissioner for about a year, and served on the Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office law enforcement advisory board. He co-founded the Center 
                City Crime Watch and has received many recognitions for his work in policing over the years. His agenda seems to be focused on increasing 
                community policing to address several known issues, leveraging strong coordination with county and state representatives to efficiently 
                solve problems, create a Community Relations Board so residents can identify and address issues with local government, and using a hands-on 
                approach with community organizations to directly address issues where government either cannot or moves too slowly.
                <br>
                <br>
                When googling McQuade, there is an article regarding being arrested several years ago.
                <a href="https://www.nj.com/cumberland/2019/03/school-board-member-charged-with-impersonating-a-police-officer-applies-for-pti.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="website-link">NJ dot com article</a>. 
                We spoke with McQuade about this incident and he thoroughly addressed it, which you can hear about in our interview below and read more about 
                in our media section at the bottom of this page.

                            Robert McQuade has made significant strides in improving Millville’s streets and public spaces. He focused on cleaning up the streets, painting curbs, and clearing gutters, working directly with the Streets and Roads department. His hands-on approach includes collaborating with local workers and addressing their needs through Total Quality Management (TQM), a system that puts employees in charge of improving their daily tasks. This practical approach aims to create a cleaner, more welcoming city for all residents.

                            McQuade is also actively involved in cleaning up areas like railroad tracks and vacant lots, ensuring the city is maintained properly. His collaboration with community members, such as candidate David Summers, highlights his willingness to tackle these tasks head-on, even utilizing personal equipment to clear waste. McQuade's ongoing engagement in these projects demonstrates his commitment to not just talking about improvements, but actually making them happen.

                            McQuade emphasizes the importance of hands-on leadership and staying connected with the people. His approach is to be the "People’s Commissioner" by attending to the concerns of residents directly, not just through formal meetings. He recalls his childhood experience of receiving care and support from Millville's firefighters and police officers, which has shaped his desire to serve the city. McQuade wants to bring back that personal connection, ensuring the public has a voice in city decisions and that officials are always approachable.

McQuade also emphasizes the importance of face-to-face interactions over digital communication, as he believes it fosters a deeper connection with residents. His personal philosophy of leading by example and working directly with the public has earned him respect as a hands-on and accessible leader.

                        <p>
                            One of McQuade’s primary concerns is the police staffing shortage in Millville. He acknowledges that the city's police force has been understaffed for years, which has a direct impact on safety. He draws from his personal experience as a part-time officer to emphasize that even when there were around 85 officers, the department was still considered understaffed. McQuade believes that any number below that is inadequate to ensure public safety.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            To address this, McQuade suggests a two-fold approach: first, securing federal grants to help fund additional officers, and second, increasing the number of class one and class two officers—officers who are less costly but still provide valuable patrolling and law enforcement. He also calls for a shift back to foot and bike patrols, which he believes can enhance police visibility and community interaction, making it easier to spot potential issues before they escalate.

                            McQuade understands that Millville’s economic future is tied to its ability to grow its tax base. One of his key priorities is expanding industrial development, particularly through projects like the NAB road extension. This extension would provide a more efficient truck route to Millville’s industrial park and airport, reducing congestion in residential areas and encouraging further investment. McQuade sees the expansion as a vital step toward bringing more business and jobs to the area, which in turn will increase local revenue.

                        <p>
                            Beyond physical infrastructure, McQuade emphasizes that the city must find sustainable ways to generate revenue without overburdening its residents. He opposes raising taxes as a solution, instead focusing on bringing in more businesses and leveraging existing resources. For McQuade, the key to a stable economy is not only industrial growth but also creating a balanced and fair tax system that benefits everyone.

                            McQuade approaches the issue of cannabis sales with caution. While he supports medical cannabis for those in need, he expresses concern about the impact of recreational cannabis sales, particularly in relation to schools and neighborhoods. McQuade voted against a proposal to place a cannabis dispensary near a charter school on Weaten Avenue, citing the proximity to young children as a significant concern. He also raises the issue of cannabis sales in Millville, particularly in areas where the city has not yet decided on the appropriate zoning for dispensaries.

                            McQuade believes that the community’s opinion should be a major factor in determining where cannabis dispensaries are located. He advocates for listening to residents, local businesses, and other stakeholders before making decisions that could affect the entire city. McQuade’s cautious approach reflects his desire to balance economic growth with community safety and well-being.

                            McQuade is deeply critical of Millville’s current form of government under the Walsh Act, describing it as inefficient and outdated. He compares the commission system to a household where all members have equal power, making it difficult to get things done. Without a final decision-maker, important projects and decisions often stall. McQuade argues that switching to a mayor-led system would provide the leadership and clarity necessary for effective governance.

                            In his view, the Walsh Act system is a relic of the past and needs reform. He points to his experience on the city commission, where he worked with colleagues like Joe Suie to build consensus and address issues. However, he believes that to move Millville forward, the city needs a more decisive leadership structure, where a single individual can take responsibility for key decisions and drive the city’s progress.

He identifies the shortage as a major obstacle to effectively addressing crime, particularly in high-risk areas. His plan includes bringing in additional officers through federal grants, increasing class one and class two officers, and enhancing community policing through foot and bike patrols. By directly engaging with the community, McQuade believes the police force can regain the trust of residents and work more effectively to reduce crime.

McQuade is also focused on attracting more businesses to Millville by improving infrastructure and providing incentives for development, helping create a more vibrant local economy that provides more jobs and services to residents.
