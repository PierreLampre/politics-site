              <p>          

                Lawrence Moore is the Deputy Mayor of Harrison Township and a Republican candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly in Legislative 
                District 3. With over a decade of public service, he combines hands-on municipal leadership with frontline emergency experience as a 
                longtime volunteer firefighter and current Captain of the Harmony Fire Company. Moore helped deliver what may be Harrison Township’s 
                first tax decrease and has built his reputation on keeping communities safe, cutting costs, and improving day-to-day services.
                <br>
                <br>
                A proud son of a school bus driver, Moore frames his candidacy around making New Jersey affordable for working families and holding 
                Trenton accountable. He has now launched a campaign website that outlines his priorities — from tax relief and parental rights in 
                education to reforming government and supporting first responders — providing voters with more structured information than in past 
                cycles. Continued direct communication through public events and voter-facing interviews would further strengthen transparency and 
                help residents see how he plans to carry his local record to the State House.

              <h6 class="page-title">Lawrence Moore</h6>
              <p>          
                Lawrence Moore, a Republican candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly in Legislative District 3, has begun to provide voters with a 
                clearer picture of his priorities compared to earlier in the campaign. He now maintains a campaign website outlining his agenda — from tax 
                relief and parental rights in education to supporting first responders and reforming government — which marks a significant step forward 
                from relying solely on scattered press mentions and social posts.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to his online presence, Moore has made limited but meaningful in-person contacts. He spoke briefly at a Republican breakfast 
                and also had a roughly five-minute off-the-record conversation with InformTheVoteNJ at the Cumberland County Fair. While that encounter 
                provided some insight into his perspective, it was not a formal or public-facing discussion. More encounters at well-advertised campaign 
                events would help move those interactions into the public realm and give voters a better understanding of his priorities and agenda.
                <br>
                <br>
                As with Konawel, it’s also important to recognize that some of the campaign’s outreach and media decisions reflect broader strategy choices, 
                not just individual candidate behavior. Such strategies can carry both benefits and drawbacks for press access and voter transparency, and it 
                remains to be seen how this approach will develop as the election season unfolds. It's also worth noting that this type of strategy decision 
                is not unique to the Konawel-Moore ticket.
                <br>
                <br>
                Taken together, Moore’s new website and limited but growing public engagement represent a meaningful improvement from his earlier low rating. 
                Proactive participation in structured voter information efforts, public interviews, and clearer communication of his campaign schedule 
                could push him toward an “above average” rating heading into the general election.

                    <p>
                    Konawel emphasizes lowering the overall cost of living so seniors, working families, and small businesses can stay and thrive in New Jersey.
                    His plan focuses on capping property taxes, expanding relief for homeowners, cutting wasteful spending in Trenton, and lowering income and business
                    taxes to keep jobs local. He also supports tax-deductible student loan interest and incentives for graduates who choose to live and work in the state.

                    Konawel prioritizes public safety and first responder support. He proposes repealing “Sanctuary State” policies, fixing bail reform laws so violent
                    offenders are held accountable, and restoring protections like qualified immunity so officers can do their jobs effectively. He also wants to reduce
                    administrative burdens so police spend more time fighting crime, not paperwork, and restore COLA pensions for police and fire personnel.

                    Konawel supports a “Parents’ Bill of Rights” to ensure curriculum transparency, age-appropriate lessons, and limit political agendas in classrooms.
                    He calls for fixing the broken school funding formula so South Jersey gets its fair share, expanding vocational training and career pipelines, and
                    supporting school choice so families have real options.

                    Konawel seeks to end Phil Murphy’s Energy Master Plan and reform the Board of Public Utilities to break up monopoly control and lower utility costs.
                    He opposes offshore wind farms that threaten the shore and raise rates, and instead supports an all-of-the-above energy plan — natural gas, nuclear,
                    and renewables — to provide affordable and reliable electricity.

                    Konawel opposes state mandates that force high-density housing into towns without adequate schools, jobs, or infrastructure. He supports protecting
                    open space and farmland from overdevelopment and requiring developers — not taxpayers — to pay for infrastructure upgrades.

                    protecting farmland preservation while maintaining collateral value for farmers, and supporting NJ-grown products to keep agriculture strong.

                    transparency on major spending bills by mandating a two-week public review before votes. His “Customer First Initiative” aims to make state agencies
                    responsive and respectful to residents.

                    supporting free-market health options to lower costs, protecting Social Security and Medicare for seniors, and expanding mental health

                    a Voter Fraud Task Force inside the Attorney General’s office, and removing party bosses from election boards.

                    managing the fishing industry scientifically rather than politically, and restoring wildlife management like the bear hunt guided by experts.

                    He wants to halt the costly Gloucester Camden Line, disband the South Jersey Transportation Authority, and audit NJ Transit to cut waste and
                    prioritize South Jersey road and bridge improvements.

                With over a decade of public service — from fighting fires to fighting for taxpayers — Lawrence Moore has built a career around community 
                safety, responsible governance, and hands-on service. He currently serves as the Deputy Mayor of Harrison Township, where he helped deliver 
                what may be the township’s first tax decrease, and he also serves as Deputy Municipal Clerk for South Harrison Township, managing planning 
                and zoning, tax collection, vital records, and administrative operations.

                <br>
                Moore’s experience includes working as a legislative aide for former New Jersey Assemblywoman Beth Sawyer, giving him first-hand insight 
                into policy development and constituent services. Academically, he holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from Rutgers–Camden 
                University and is pursuing a master’s in public administration at the University of Pennsylvania’s Fels Institute of Government.

                A proud son of a school bus driver, Moore understands the financial pressures facing working families in New Jersey. He has served for more 
                than 12 years as a volunteer firefighter and is currently Captain of the Harmony Fire Company, leading on the frontlines of public safety. 
                This blend of local executive experience, state-level legislative work, and emergency service shapes Moore’s approach to making New Jersey
                more affordable and accountable for the next generation.
