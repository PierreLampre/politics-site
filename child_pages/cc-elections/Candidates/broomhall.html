              <p>          

                As of 10/13/2025, Candidate Broomhall has provided little in the way of public-facing campaign information. As with other candidates, InformTheVoteNJ has made outreach through the 
                clerk’s office, online searches, and direct communication, but a clear platform or dedicated campaign material has not been made available.
                <br>
                <br>
                Broomhall did participate in the recent 4 Seasons candidate forum, though we cannot report on much at the request of the host. Unlike several of her peers, she did attend 
                InformTheVoteNJ’s recent meet n greet and is a tentative “maybe” for the upcoming candidate forum at the Millville Public Library, which will be recorded.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s also worth noting that she was recently involved in some election-season turmoil, where she expressed that part of her low public presence stemmed from concerns about 
                bullying and cyber-stalking. While those concerns are real and understandable, the effect is that voters still lack the ability to clearly see her positions and agenda. Until more 
                accessible, shareable campaign material is provided, her visibility and transparency remain limited, leaving much of the electorate in the dark about where she stands.

              <h6 class="page-title">Victoria Broomhall</h6>
              <p>          

                Candidate Broomhall is currently rated below average (trending upwards) in transparency and accessibility. While she has taken a few meaningful steps forward—such as attending 
                InformTheVoteNJ’s meet n greet and leaving the door open to join the upcoming public forum at the library—her overall campaign presence remains limited.
                <br>
                <br>
                Broomhall has expressed concerns about bullying and cyber-stalking, and those concerns are valid. At the same time, voters cannot be left without accessible, verifiable information. 
                Multiple opportunities have been available for her to provide a platform, long-form interview, or other public-facing material, and those opportunities have not yet been taken.
                <br>
                <br>
                For now, her engagement places her above candidates who have avoided all public interaction, but without a more consistent and transparent presence, voters are still left without 
                the clarity needed to fully evaluate her candidacy.

                    <strong>Explanation</strong>
                </summary>
                Victoria Broomhall’s campaign is one of the more complex and cautionary cases of the 2025 Millville City Commission race. At the start of the 
                season, she was largely unknown outside of political circles, with little to no digital footprint or direct campaign presence. Over time, 
                it became clear that she was already a familiar face at City Hall meetings, often attending sessions long before this election cycle began. 
                That background positions her as civically aware and engaged—but awareness alone is not transparency or accessibility.
                <br><br>
                Broomhall did not initially respond to outreach attempts, and her first interaction with InformTheVoteNJ came in person at the Four Seasons 
                Forum. Her remarks at that event were substantive, touching on local priorities and frustrations, but the lack of recording means voters 
                cannot review them for themselves. She was invited to the InformTheVoteNJ Brewery Meet & Greet, and early rumors suggested she would 
                appear. At that event, she was invited to the recorded Candidates Forum, and she was a maybe with expressing interest in attending, but withdrew 
                midweek, citing scheduling conflicts.
                <br><br>
                Taken individually, any of these decisions might be understandable. But taken together—over five months of open invitations, multiple 
                available formats, and a crowded field of candidates making appearances—they reflect a pattern of selective participation that undermines 
                overall accessibility.
                <br><br>
                Compounding this issue is her limited and erratic social media presence. Broomhall made a rare Facebook post during the campaign accusing 
                another candidate of creating a smear site, claiming to have “traced the IP address.” While candidates are free to engage how they wish, 
                this kind of post crosses into questionable territory for a local race—especially when paired with statements about avoiding social 
                media due to concerns about “cyber-stalking.” That contradiction doesn’t just raise ethical questions; it calls into doubt whether her 
                online statements and civic posture are consistent with the transparency she expects from others. Not only that, but it calls into question 
                the overall validity of the issue she raised... if she isn't communicative, how can we be confident about verifying her claims?
                <br><br>
                The larger issue is proportionality. In a race with nineteen candidates—many of whom participated in interviews, forums, and public events—it 
                isn’t enough to rely on informal reputation or the rumor mill. Residents deserve a chance to see, hear, and evaluate each candidate’s 
                platform directly. When candidates pick and choose what limited public appearances they’re comfortable with, the result is an uneven 
                information landscape where only a subset of voices are publicly documented.
                <br><br>
                To her credit, Broomhall appears to care about Millville’s future and has some grounding in local issues. But effective public service 
                requires courage under scrutiny. Campaigning is the proving ground for that courage. When a candidate opts out of opportunities for fair, 
                public dialogue—especially after months of open invitations—it becomes difficult to argue that voters have been given a fair chance to 
                understand who she is or what she represents.
                <br><br>
                Overall rating: Poor — demonstrates some civic awareness and potential, but undermined by selective participation, inconsistent messaging, 
                and avoidance of public-facing accountability opportunities.

                Broomhall intends to collaborate with fellow commissioners and city staff to find funding sources to replace the crumbling system,

                She criticizes unfulfilled promises from developers and investors that have left the city with “more bills, more crime, and more decay.” 
                Her goal is to build a city that prioritizes long-term stability, safety, and quality of life.

                She emphasizes that “We the People, By the People” should define Millville’s government—not outside influence.

                Having traveled across multiple states and countries, Broomhall says she’s gained perspective on how much potential Millville has compared

                She pledges to bring that broader worldview back home to inspire new ideas and stronger civic standards.

            "I am a lifelong resident of Millville graduating in 2021 with a safety and sanitation culinary certificate. I currently work for a retail company as a team leader for my department. Helping promote revenue generation, and leading my team through the product placement process. I have several years of experience volunteering for various local projects. I first started attending commission meetings when I was 13. I love to travel, I’ve been to many other states and countries. I have learned there’s a whole world outside of Cumberland County and Millville is being left behind! I am not bought And paid for by any outside interest. I don’t have any signs, commercials, or airplanes. I believe in We the people By the people. No loyalty to engineers, law, firms, or developers. My loyalty is, has, and will always be with the residents of Millville. I will work with fellow commissioners and city staff to the find funding desperately needed to replace our crumbling water supply system. Our community’s basic needs have been neglected for too long. Broken promises from developers and investors with a lack of accountability has left residents with only more bills,  more crime and more decay. It is time to put the residents needs above all else. I will seek new and innovative ways to create a more sustainable future for our residents seeking a safe, healthy and happy quality of life. From the child family center to Millville senior high school, Millville is my hometown. And more important is that I intend to continue living and working here. I am running for Millville city commission because the future of Millville is my future!

            Some of my reasons for avoiding posting on social media include that I’m well aware that my mom has a strong social media presence in Millville and I intentionally choose to stand apart from that. Our current vice mayor doesn’t use social media along with a few other candidates. I do my best to participate by attending as many open forums that I’ve been invited to and my schedule allowed."

            <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
            "I feel obligated to speak out.  

            I am a candidate for the Millville City Commission and I was recently made aware of a website called “Millville Votes”. It appears someone has created a website for a smear campaign against a fellow female candidate. The attack was extremely personal and not relevant to her policies, abilities or the needs of Millville. No one deserves that kind of treatment in a municipal election.

            My fear of cyberstalking has been the primary reason why I have avoiding using social media to campaign.  I am not making this post to gain support for my campaign. I am posting this because too often, women don’t call out poor behavior out of fear that we’ll be next. The reality is that the more we let bad behavior go unchecked, the more of it we’ll probably see. 

            This election should focus on policy, ideas and dedication - not trying to destroy someone's life. Disagreements are inevitable, a candidate's personal life should be off limits. 

            I want to remind EVERYONE that when this election is over we will still be neighbors & we will still see each other in Wawa.  

            Someone I know with IT skills looked at the site and had this to say:
            I looked into the technical setup of the site. Based on publicly available information, I noticed that several websites (electdandixon.com, millvillemeansbusiness.org, millvillevotes.com, and a related business page) appear to share the same hosting infrastructure on Amazon’s servers (76.223.105.230 and 13.248.243.5, as of the day I checked). The configuration details, such as hosting locations and timing of setup, looked very similar. All sites share the same AWS Global Accelerator IPs (76.223.105.230 primary, plus anycast failover), a textbook sign of single-account configuration. Easy for one person/team to manage multiple domains via AWS Route 53 or similar. The consistent TTL (3600s) and reverse DNS (a16e665f42988324c.awsglobalaccelerator.com)."
