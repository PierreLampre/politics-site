                <br>
                When asked how to address the state's budget and achieve fiscal responsibility, White-Morris spoke about looking at the 
                state's specific budget, seek grants that are available, and hold people accountable in regards to making sure money 
                is being spent where it should be spent.

                To note: A "general discussion point" is a summarized part of the video that might not have come from a direct question and 
                answer format, but part of a tangent or general discussion.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                1. Host: Tell us who you are.
                <br>
                <br>
                Smith: Community advocate, union member, sorority member, a leader. Born and raised in Bridgeton. Proud to be her 
                father’s daughter, who was very active in the community. Bridgeton High School graduate, 2002. Graduate of Delaware 
                State University. Has a criminal justice degree. Graduate of Wilmington University with a masters in administration of 
                justice with a concentration in homeland security. One of my motivations for running is that being a person of color, 
                my parents did not have the same opportunities that I have, including getting an advanced education. So they wanted to 
                make sure I had an education and now I want to follow through on that vision… and I believe that’s why I am also an 
                educator today. I worked for Bridgeton public schools for 15 years. Through my experience as an attendance officer, I 
                realized how broken our community is and that we needed people to go above and beyond normal expectations. I remember
                being 9 or 10 years old and telling my mom that I wanted to help people. Through my years of being involved in 
                community affairs, I have a network where I can help get things done by making some phone calls and sending some text 
                messages. I want to send a positive ‘can-do’ message through the community. I am a director of early childhood education. 
                Feels strongly about her faith and using it to move forward. I had a very humble way of accepting my nomination as a party 
                candidate for assembly, but when I got my father’s approval I knew it was the right thing.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Host: At what point did you realize you were going to run for office? 
                <br>
                <br>
                White-Morris: I was tired of going to my student’s funerals. This person got shot, this one has been killed… when is it 
                finally going to be enough? There is a lot of talk on facebook, and it lasts for a day or two, but then we go right 
                back to our old ways. When are we going to take back our village?
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                3. General discussion point: We have to show our children that split second decisions have 
                consequences, because our families and communities are setting the bad example that even if you do something wrong and 
                go through the system, the children get the impression that it’s ok, without realizing that the consequences will 
                follow them.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                4. Host: How do we get the basic respect factor instilled back into our kids?
                <br>
                <br>
                White-Morris: Government has taken away power. We have so many government systems set in place that they are being 
                abused and parents are afraid of doing or saying the wrong thing, which could then be used against the parents for 
                punishment.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                5. General discussion point: COVID exposed that we have been programmed to only go to work to keep a roof over our 
                heads, and so we’ve left the parenting up to the schools. By the time we get home from work, we are too tired to do 
                anything else. We’re not checking homework, and sometimes the kids aren’t even getting homework. It has gotten to the 
                point where we are graduating kids who can’t even read.
                <br>
                <br>
                White-Morris: As an early childhood educator, I have seen all kinds of problems with kids regarding mental health 
                problems, autism, etc. And then when the parents come in, I have seen some teachers with the attitude that it’s not 
                their job to help the parents, which I don’t think is right. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Host: But we also have to allow the teachers to give the parents criticism. For example, if a teacher tells a parent 
                that their child is misbehaving in school, the parents should listen and try to understand that their child might 
                actually be misbehaving, instead of the parents getting defensive.
