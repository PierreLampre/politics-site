              <p>
                Heather Whitaker has a lot of experience working within the school system, including years of experience on the PTA and direct school board experience. She is 
                particularly passionate about the importance of board members having children in the school system so that they are inherently motivated to make changes when necessary,
                as opposed to comfortably going along with the status quo. Click the x at the top red of this box to go back to the page, then scroll down for more info.

                        Most of the current board members don't have children or grandchildren in the system.

                    <li>She will be heavily involved in the process. Many board members don't ask enough questions to understand what is going on and simply keep the status quo, 
                        sometimes even shutting down people who ask probing questions.
