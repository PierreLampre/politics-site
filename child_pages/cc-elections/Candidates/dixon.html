              <h6 class="page-title">Dan Dixon</h6>
              <p>
                Dan Dixon is a lifelong Millville resident, business owner, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu coach running for Millville City Commission in the 2025 election. With decades of experience 
                in sales, marketing, and team leadership, as well as advanced degrees in exercise science and human performance, Dixon brings a research-driven, business-minded approach to city 
                government.
                <br>
                <br>
                His top priority is tackling crime as the foundation for Millville’s revitalization, proposing a detailed 10-point plan that includes hiring more police officers, reestablishing 
                the Crime Task Force, targeting nuisance properties, and implementing proactive community safety measures. He also emphasizes creative strategies for increasing city revenue—such 
                as aggressive code enforcement, Special Improvement Districts, and a dedicated commercial property platform—to attract businesses and grow the local economy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Positioning himself as a fresh voice unbound by political games, Dixon pledges transparency, collaboration, and a commitment to making Millville a safer, stronger, and more 
                prosperous city.

                My name is Dan Dixon, and I am a lifelong Millville resident seeking a four-year seat on the Millville City Commission in the November 2025 election. I am running because I believe Millville deserves new energy, fresh ideas, and leaders unafraid to tackle difficult problems head-on.
                <br><br>
                My mission is simple: to make Millville safer, stronger, and more appealing for residents, businesses, and visitors. I believe transparency and accountability are critical to rebuilding trust in local government, and I am committed to openly sharing my plans, progress, and challenges with the public.
