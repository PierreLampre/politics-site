              <p>
                Dan Dixon is a lifelong Millville resident, business owner, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu coach running for Millville City Commission in the 2025 election. With decades of experience 
                in sales, marketing, and team leadership, as well as advanced degrees in exercise science and human performance, Dixon brings a research-driven, business-minded approach to city 
                government.
                <br>
                <br>
                His top priority is tackling crime as the foundation for Millville’s revitalization, proposing a detailed 10-point plan that includes hiring more police officers, reestablishing 
                the Crime Task Force, targeting nuisance properties, and implementing proactive community safety measures. He also emphasizes creative strategies for increasing city revenue—such 
                as aggressive code enforcement, Special Improvement Districts, and a dedicated commercial property platform—to attract businesses and grow the local economy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Positioning himself as a fresh voice unbound by political games, Dixon pledges transparency, collaboration, and a commitment to making Millville a safer, stronger, and more 
                prosperous city.

              <h6 class="page-title">Dan Dixon</h6>
              <p>          
                Dan Dixon has taken meaningful steps to make himself accessible and transparent as a candidate for Millville City Commission. His campaign 
                website goes further than most of his peers by outlining his platform in detail, giving voters a clear sense of his priorities and values. 
                He has also scheduled a meet-and-greet in the coming weeks, signaling a willingness to show up in person and take questions directly from 
                the community. When I spoke with him by phone, he was responsive and straightforward: he acknowledged my questionnaire, explained he needed 
                more time to prepare thoughtful answers, and made it clear he intends to follow through before moving into interviews.
                <br>
                <br>
                That balance—having some strong public-facing materials while also asking for a little breathing room on deeper questions—puts Dixon in a 
                position that is better than average, but still shy of the highest standard. And to note, the overwhelming amount of candidates in the county 
                don't reach top tier, because recent elections have raised the bar. Whether it's Donald Trump doing a 3 hour podcast or Steven Fulop outlining 
                70 pages of policy, there are possibilities that go beyond the status quo of local politics. That being said, Dan's approach 
                strongly suggests a candidate who values transparency and accessibility but is taking his time to make sure he does it the right way. 
                In a county where voters too often get surface-level campaign blurbs, even this level of preparation already moves him into the 
                “above average” category.
                <br>
                <br>
                The question is what happens next. If Dixon follows through on his plan to complete the questionnaire, sit for interviews, and keep building 
                a two-way channel with the public, he could easily rise into the top tier of transparency. The groundwork is there: he’s already 
                engaging online, scheduling in-person events, and picking up the phone when asked. The next step is checking the remaining 'beyond status 
                quo boxes'. Sometimes it's not about the individual candidate, but pushing the county towards a higher standard.
                <br>
                <br>
                For now, Dixon earns an above-average transparency rating, with clear momentum toward the top tier. If he keeps building on what he has 
                started, he could set a new expectation for what candidate accessibility looks like in Millville.

                        <p>In this ~21-minute campaign presentation, Millville City Commission candidate <strong>Dan Dixon</strong> introduces his background as a third-generation Millville resident, small-business owner, and longtime coach/instructor. He traces a path from sales/marketing management to founding Impact Fitness &amp; Martial Arts (2007–present), highlighting relationship-building, revenue generation, and team leadership.</p>

                        <p><strong>Core Thesis:</strong><br>
                        Millville needs a proactive “standard-bearer” who can <em>sell and market the city</em>, build relationships with developers, and make it easier to do business here. Dixon pairs that with a public-safety focus, arguing that <em>crime reduction and economic development must move together</em>.</p>

                        <p><strong>Public Safety &amp; Code Tools:</strong><br>
                        He points to a 10-point crime plan leveraging code enforcement, nuisance-property designations, and landlord accountability to target a small core of repeat offenders. The goal is to stabilize neighborhoods so families feel safe and investment can follow.</p>

                        <p><strong>Economic Development &amp; Ease of Doing Business:</strong><br>
                        Dixon proposes a dedicated portal—<em>“MillvilleMeansBusiness.org”</em>—with a step-by-step guide, a business liaison, and a live inventory of city-owned and private commercial properties. He emphasizes proactive outreach to firms planning expansions and prioritizing higher-wage employers.</p>

                        <p><strong>Closing Message:</strong><br>
                        Rejecting the idea that Millville is a “lost cause,” Dixon calls for disciplined policy, consistent marketing, and community involvement. He invites residents to events, asks for support, and frames service as a net sacrifice undertaken out of commitment to the city.</p>

                            <p>At this meet-and-greet, Millville City Commission candidate <strong>Dan Dixon</strong> lays out a clear priority: <em>public safety before (and alongside) economic development</em>. He argues investors won’t commit serious dollars without visible safety improvements and says the city has had the sequence backwards.</p>

                            <p><strong>Police Staffing &amp; Retention:</strong><br>
                            Dixon notes the hiring lag (academy + field training ≈ ~10 months) and emphasizes retention as the immediate pain point. He cites step-pay gaps of roughly $15–20k compared to Vineland that pull officers away and calls for getting sworn strength to ~85 and keeping it there.</p>

                            <p><strong>Code Enforcement &amp; Nuisance Properties:</strong><br>
                            He urges aggressive use of nuisance-property tools (e.g., citations after qualifying calls within 90 days), pushing for trials in absentia, bench warrants, and—per a newer state statute—rolling unpaid fines into the <em>tax bill</em> (not just a lien) to trigger foreclosure if ignored. Goal: make negligent landlords more selective and accountable.</p>

                            <p><strong>Focus on Repeat Offenders &amp; Youth Prevention:</strong><br>
                            Dixon frames a three-prong approach: (1) law enforcement pressure on a relatively small group (≈200–300) driving most violence and disorder; (2) nuisance-property enforcement to disrupt hot spots; (3) prevention with community partners (e.g., inner-city youth outreach) to redirect kids before they choose the wrong path.</p>

                            <p><strong>Illegal Bikes/ATVs &amp; Pursuit Limits:</strong><br>
                            He proposes a <em>drone program</em> to identify and seize illegal bikes/ATVs (with unclaimed vehicles destroyed after a hold period), noting state-level pursuit restrictions on traffic infractions limit MPD’s options.</p>

                            <p><strong>Closing:</strong><br>
                            Dixon rejects fatalism about Millville’s future, asks residents to spread the word, grab yard signs, and push for policies—and statewide leadership—that support law enforcement and neighborhood stability.</p>

                            Dan Dixon’s top priority is addressing crime as the foundation for Millville’s revitalization. He argues that economic growth is impossible without first making Millville safer for families and businesses.

                        <p>
                            His 10-point plan for public safety includes:
                            <ul>

                                <li>Passing a content-neutral traffic safety ordinance to address standing in high-traffic areas and enforcing private property panhandling restrictions.</li>
                                <li>Holding slumlords accountable for unsafe and nuisance properties through stricter penalties and enforcement.</li>
                                <li>Seizing and redeveloping long-abandoned or non-compliant properties.</li>

                                <li>Implementing drug, anti-gang, and crime prevention education programs in schools.</li>
                                <li>Placing limits on new affordable housing development to prevent over-concentration and strain on city resources.</li>
                                <li>Collaborating with county, state, and federal agencies to dismantle drug networks in Millville.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Dixon also emphasizes evidence-based strategies, such as focused deterrence programs, community engagement, environmental design improvements, and public health approaches to reduce crime, citing successful examples from other U.S. cities.

                                <li>Developing a city-managed commercial property platform to attract businesses and showcase Millville’s advantages.</li>
                                <li>Establishing Special Improvement Districts (SIDs) to fairly assess properties that disproportionately use city resources, reinvesting funds into security, beautification, and infrastructure.</li>
                                <li>Implementing aggressive code enforcement to hold absentee landlords accountable, generate fine revenue, and improve property values over time.</li>
                                <li>Partnering with private and public entities to foster economic growth through strategic redevelopment and targeted incentives.</li>
                            </ul>

                            Dixon positions himself as a candidate with a fresh, business-oriented perspective rather than a career politician. He emphasizes openness, accountability, and collaborative problem-solving as his guiding principles for city governance.

                            He sees Millville’s challenges as requiring bold, creative action and invites residents to share ideas to shape solutions together.
