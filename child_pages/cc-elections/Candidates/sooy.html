            <h6 class="page-title">Joe Sooy</h6>
            <p>
            Joe Sooy is seeking re-election to the Millville City Commission. A lifelong Millville resident, Sooy blends
            hands-on operational experience (U.S. Air Force communications tech; Wheaton Glass CNC/NC maintenance) with a
            mathematics degree and senior leadership roles in New Jersey corrections and public-sector unions. He frames his
            candidacy around continuity: finishing large, in-motion projects and protecting one-time revenues from being
            spent on short bursts that don’t compound for taxpayers.
            <br><br>
            His 2025 focus areas: (1) lock in the Community Realty Partners (CRP) land sale at Hurley Industrial Park (~$10M)
            and reinvest proceeds into infrastructure; (2) keep economic development moving (La Vonia meat-cutting/packing
            facility, Buckshutem Rd warehousing) to grow ratables; (3) operational discipline—use UEZ tools smartly, pave
            Columbia Ave, expand façade grants; (4) implement recently passed retail-cannabis licensing (3 shops) as a revenue
            stream for safe streets and roads; (5) sustain master-plan modernization and avoid policy reversals that stall
            momentum.
            <br><br>
            On homelessness and public safety, he argues local ordinances are undermined by state-level bail reform and
            enforcement limits; he favors accountability for repeat offenders and wants state leaders pressed on practical
            fixes. He’s skeptical that county/state initiatives like the “Middle Mile” broadband ring would benefit Millville
            residents relative to cost, preferring targeted, city-level investments with clear ROI.

            <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
            <h6 class="page-title">Joe Sooy</h6>
            <p>
            In conversation, Sooy shows a command of details and a willingness to defend trade-offs, often grounding answers in the mechanics of projects, ordinances, or finance rules. That 
            clarity is valuable, but what rounds out a strong campaign is how accessible that clarity becomes to the public. Beyond long interviews, voters usually look for touchpoints like 
            meet-and-greets, an official campaign website, or even short, regular updates on project status.
            <br><br>
            Millville’s political culture often looks contentious on camera, and Sooy doesn’t shy from that. He argues open debate is part of accountability—even when bluntness is labeled 
            as “mean.” But from a campaign perspective, adding more structured outreach could broaden the picture: making his transparency and process-based approach visible in settings where 
            residents aren’t tuning in to full meetings or multi-hour interviews.
            <br><br>
            From an InformTheVoteNJ standpoint, Sooy rates above average for transparency and accessibility because he engages directly and provides detailed answers. To push toward “top tier,” 
            a few classic campaign elements—like a public event series, consistent web presence, or a simple quarterly progress update—would make his message and project tracking easier for 
            voters to follow outside of City Hall.

                        In this interview, Millville Commissioner Joe Sooy lays out why incumbency matters when big projects are mid-flight.
                        He emphasizes finishing the CRP land sale at Hurley Industrial Park (~$10M) and reinvesting proceeds into
                        infrastructure rather than one-off spending; keeping recent wins moving (La Vony meat-cutting/packing facility,
                        Buckshutem Rd warehousing in due diligence); and using UEZ tools (expanded zone, $20k façade grants, Columbia Ave
                        paving) to make visible progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He ties his mathematics training to a “multi-variable” approach: change one input, you must adjust others to keep
                        the output (outcomes) constant—whether structuring redevelopment bonds without direct taxpayer cost or sequencing
                        permitting to avoid stalls. On homelessness and crime, he pushes for state-level fixes to bail/enforcement that local
                        ordinances can’t overcome alone. He supports leveraging now-legal retail cannabis (3 licenses) to fund safe streets
                        and roads, even though he opposed legalization at the time. He’s skeptical the county “Middle Mile” broadband ring
                        would deliver value to Millville relative to cost and prefers focused city investments with clearer ROI.

                    <p>One of the first truly meaningful local interviews I recorded. Joe Sooy (Millville Vice Mayor/Commissioner) walks through the real trade-offs behind Millville’s growth: ratables vs. rural character, the airport/industrial park, Nabb Avenue, cannabis revenue, recruitment/retention for police, Laurel Lake infrastructure, state mandates, county projects (jail &amp; middle-mile broadband), and what “crime” looks like on the ground vs. the stats.</p>

                    <p><strong>Context:</strong> This conversation was recorded when Sooy was a sitting commissioner not then on the ballot. I’m preparing a new interview with him as he runs for re-election; use this as background on his approach. Details may have evolved.</p>

                    The pending Community Realty Partners purchase (~$10M) at Hurley Industrial Park is a once-only revenue event.
                    Sooy argues the proceeds must be reinvested into infrastructure that unlocks future growth (roads/utilities/site
                    readiness), not used for one-time outlays that don’t compound. CRP’s plan includes warehousing, a hotel, and
                    professional office space—projects that can lift ratables and employment near the airport.

                    to catalyze private upgrades along High Street and adjacent corridors.

                    <p>
                    With the ordinance passed, Millville will accept applications for <strong>three</strong> retail dispensaries. Though Sooy
                    opposed legalization at the time, he argues the city should now capture its fair share of revenue (2% local tax on
                    sales) to fund policing and road work—rather than ceding that revenue to neighboring towns.

                    <p>
                    After a decade-plus of fits and starts, the city master plan and zoning map have been overhauled. Sooy credits the
                    planning board and staff for the heavy lift and wants to ensure new rules guide growth coherently, avoiding ad-hoc
                    reversals that waste time and investor confidence.

                    <p>
                    Sooy distinguishes between financial-distress cases (most solvable locally) and mental-health/substance-use cases
                    (require state-level systems that currently fall short). He argues bail reform and enforcement limits blunt the
                    impact of local ordinances (e.g., park camping), and calls for pressing state leaders on practical fixes that give
                    cities tools that actually work.

                    <p>
                    Post-COVID work norms and uneven expectations required a reset. Sooy emphasizes resident-first accountability,
                    insisting on policy/law citations for “can’t do that” answers and addressing persistent under-performance so the
                    burden doesn’t fall on high-performing staff.

                    Sooy is not convinced a county-run fiber ring would deliver value for Millville relative to cost; he favors
                    targeted, city-level investments with measurable returns and questions whether government should compete where
                    private providers already operate.
