              <p>
                Candidate Woody is a lifelong resident of Cedarville who wants to restore a sense of pride throughout his community. While growing up, he believes there was a strong sense of 
                community where everyone knew each other, the township residents could leave their doors unlocked, and there were things to do. He feels as though that standard has slipped 
                through the years. In that direct vein, he wants to invest in creating engaging spaces for children, including using the local senior center for kids activities during after
                school hours and looking into the successful plans of neighboring districts building skate parks. Furthermore, he wants to provide a stronger sense of transparency in local 
                government by doing things such as live-streaming and posting recordings of committee meetings, having residents post questions for the committee online when they don't have a 
                chance to make it to meetings, and raising the online presence of local government through updating its website and leveraging social media. A few examples regarding needing to 
                update the township website are an

                    <summary style="cursor:pointer; color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">Incorrect Mayor Position Listing</summary>
                        <img src="../../../assets/screenshots/mayorMixup.png" alt="Screenshot Thumbnail" id="screenshotThumbnail" style="cursor:pointer; width:100%; max-width: 80vw; margin-top: 10px;">
                        As shown in the image, you can see the listing of Lawrence Township elected positions found in the Cumberland County Directory of 2024, that Elmer "Skip" Bowman 
                        is the mayor and Joseph Miletta is a committeeman... while on the right you can see on the Lawrence Township website that Joseph Miletta is listed as mayor and 
                        Elmer Skip Bowman is listed as Deputy Mayor. It is our understanding that Bowman became mayor at the beginning of 2024. While some might see this as a small 
                        oversight regarding website maintenance, modernizing and digitizing local government has been a common priority, as mentioned in last year's surrogate race and 
                        this year's County Clerk's race. It is 2024 after all, and this is just one example that Woody points out... and he sometimes gets asked by residents who even is 
                        the mayor, because they are unsure.

                        As shown in the image, you can see the a bunch of empty white boxes with our question marks over top of them. And if you look at the dates of the posted minutes,
                        it seems as though minutes weren't posted from about September 11th, 2023 until April 4-8 2024, and none afterwards. To be fair, apparently you can request minutes 
                        that have not been posted, but that might not be obvious to users, as it is visually inconsistent. In other words, in 2024, Woody feels this is another example of 
                        modern digitalization expectations not being met. And we here at InformTheVoteNJ generally agree, while the county has been making progress at digitalization, 
                        there is still much work to be done, and regular website maintenance is key to providing the public easily accessible information.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While I may be younger than my opponent, I have not lost sight of our town's rich history or the challenges we currently face. It is essential to prioritize transparency 
                    with our taxpayers. We must be diligent in tracking the allocation of funds and shining a light on our expenditures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is disheartening to witness the current committee's lack of transparency. Many residents are struggling to make ends meet, and some are at risk of losing their homes. 
                    The response of the current administration-"You should have shown up to a meetin"-is dismissive and fails to acknowledge the diverse work schedules of our community 
                    members. To foster an inclusive environment, I propose that our meetings be live-streamed, allowing those who cannot attend in person to participate meaningfully. 
                    Furthermore, I believe in the importance of creating a channel for residents to submit their questions via email so they can be addressed during meetings at their 
                    convenience. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our township website requires updated maintenance and user-friendly access. I commit to being available for any inquiries from my fellow neighbors, ensuring no one 
                    feels intimidated, as evidenced by inappropriate conduct displayed at the September 11, 2023, meeting.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The condition of 553 must be addressed; it poses significant safety risks to our residents. Rather than assigning blame for ownership, let's collaborate with the county 
                    to develop actionable plans that will restore our infrastructure and preserve the beauty of our beloved lake.

                    <br>
                    Our children deserve safe and engaging spaces-alternatives to merely wandering the streets. I intend to partner with local organizations to create recreational 
                    facilities that will enrich our community without imposing additional burdens on taxpayers.

                Cedarville is more than just a place on a map; it's a tapestry of memories, experiences, and shared connections that shape who we are. For many, like myself, the 
                identification with Cedarville runs deep-rooted in family legacy, acts of kindness, and the kind of community spirit that makes a small town feel like home.

                I proudly claim Cedarville as my birthplace and lifelong residence. My understanding of the importance of community was nurtured by my grandfather, Norman Burns Jr. 
                As a ten-year-old, I stood beside him, carrying bags full of food to locals in need. Our family didn't have much to spare, but we understood the significance of 
                helping others in our community. I still remember those government cheese blocks and the large cans of peanut butter that brought sustenance during hard times. As we 
                made our rounds delivering food, our home often became the last stop before the day's end. Yet, even when our family was in need, we never hesitated to pass that last 
                bag of food to someone who required it more.

                Today, our commitment to helping others continues as my family operates the local food pantry. The values instilled by my grandfather remain strong. In the past, our 
                family had teamed up to distribute Christmas gifts and festive baskets filled with candy and fruit-symbols of joy and generosity. However, reminiscent of my 
                childhood, I always received my gifts last, ensuring that others came first.

                <br>
                Yet it wasn't only my grandfather who shaped my identity as a Cedarville resident. My father, an industrious man determined to provide for four children, worked 
                tirelessly, often sacrificing precious moments of father-son bonding. Nevertheless, through my grandfather's car dealership, I developed a special connection with 
                him, and many in our town fondly remember the cars purchased from his lot.

                Cedarville's charm also manifests in the simple joys of childhood. I remember swimming at Cedarville Lake and playing on the swings with my siblings, thanks to my 
                mother-a dedicated caregiver. My mother was the daughter of Norman and Hazel Burns, and her love and support was a key element in our family's fabric, creating 
                lasting memories of togetherness.

                <br>
                In 2004, my grandfather's passing marked a significant transition in my life as I inherited the family home. It's here that I raised my two wonderful children, now 
                aged 11 and 16. As a parent, I feel a responsibility to ensure they experience the same sense of community pride that I have. I want my children to feel the same 
                connection to Cedarville that I have felt, to be able to say, "You know you're from Cedarville when..." with a sense of belonging and pride.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, I stand committed to enhancing the spirit of Cedarville and bringing back the essence of our small-town roots while looking forward to the new possibilities 
                that lie ahead for Lawrence Township. As I embark on my campaign for the Lawrence Township Committee, I humbly ask for your support. I am dedicated to working hard 
                for my family, our neighbors, and those who will join our community in the future. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Mark your calendars for November 5th, 2024, and join us in shaping a future where Cedarville remains a vibrant place with a strong community spirit-a place where 
                generosity thrives, neighbors support one another, and we cherish the memories that make our home so special. After 17 years in office, it is time for fresh leadership. 
                I respectfully urge my opponent to step aside and allow a new generation to lead our town forward. Together, we can restore pride in our community and build a brighter 
                future for all residents.Together, let's ensure our children can proudly say, "I'm from Cedarville.""
