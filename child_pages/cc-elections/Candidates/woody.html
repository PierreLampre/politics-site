                Direct quote from communication with Woody:
                <br>
                <br>
                Cedarville is more than just a place on a map; it's a tapestry of memories, experiences, and shared connections that shape who we are. For many, like myself, the 
                identification with Cedarville runs deep-rooted in family legacy, acts of kindness, and the kind of community spirit that makes a small town feel like home.
                <br>
                <br>
                I proudly claim Cedarville as my birthplace and lifelong residence. My understanding of the importance of community was nurtured by my grandfather, Norman Burns Jr. 
                As a ten-year-old, I stood beside him, carrying bags full of food to locals in need. Our family didn't have much to spare, but we understood the significance of 
                helping others in our community. I still remember those government cheese blocks and the large cans of peanut butter that brought sustenance during hard times. As we 
                made our rounds delivering food, our home often became the last stop before the day's end. Yet, even when our family was in need, we never hesitated to pass that last 
                bag of food to someone who required it more.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, our commitment to helping others continues as my family operates the local food pantry. The values instilled by my grandfather remain strong. In the past, our 
                family had teamed up to distribute Christmas gifts and festive baskets filled with candy and fruit-symbols of joy and generosity. However, reminiscent of my 
                childhood, I always received my gifts last, ensuring that others came first.
                <br>
                <br>
                Yet it wasn't only my grandfather who shaped my identity as a Cedarville resident. My father, an industrious man determined to provide for four children, worked 
                tirelessly, often sacrificing precious moments of father-son bonding. Nevertheless, through my grandfather's car dealership, I developed a special connection with 
                him, and many in our town fondly remember the cars purchased from his lot.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cedarville's charm also manifests in the simple joys of childhood. I remember swimming at Cedarville Lake and playing on the swings with my siblings, thanks to my 
                mother-a dedicated caregiver. My mother was the daughter of Norman and Hazel Burns, and her love and support was a key element in our family's fabric, creating 
                lasting memories of togetherness.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2004, my grandfather's passing marked a significant transition in my life as I inherited the family home. It's here that I raised my two wonderful children, now 
                aged 11 and 16. As a parent, I feel a responsibility to ensure they experience the same sense of community pride that I have. I want my children to feel the same 
                connection to Cedarville that I have felt, to be able to say, "You know you're from Cedarville when..." with a sense of belonging and pride.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, I stand committed to enhancing the spirit of Cedarville and bringing back the essence of our small-town roots while looking forward to the new possibilities 
                that lie ahead for Lawrence Township. As I embark on my campaign for the Lawrence Township Committee, I humbly ask for your support. I am dedicated to working hard 
                for my family, our neighbors, and those who will join our community in the future. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Mark your calendars for November 5th, 2024, and join us in shaping a future where Cedarville remains a vibrant place with a strong community spirit-a place where 
                generosity thrives, neighbors support one another, and we cherish the memories that make our home so special. Together, let's ensure our children can proudly say, 
                "I'm from Cedarville.""
