                  <p>          
    
                    Charlie Woody is a lifelong resident of Cedarville whose campaign focuses on community service, local pride, and practical problem-solving. His platform includes 
                    proposals for improving government transparency, cleaning up abandoned properties, addressing concerns over Route 553 and 393 Main Street, and creating safer spaces 
                    for childrenâ€”all while emphasizing open communication and taxpayer accountability. With a campaign website, consistent township meeting attendance, and a commitment 
                    to participating in a public forum, Woody receives an above-average transparency rating. While there's still room to improve the frequency of updates and finalization 
                    of public events, his willingness to engage and address specific local concerns makes him one of the more accessible candidates in the county.

                  <h6 class="page-title">Charlie Woody</h6>
                  <p>          
    
                    Charlie Woody is a returning candidate for Lawrence Township Committee who has made a clear effort to raise the standard for local campaign transparency. While he hasnâ€™t 
                    reached the top tier yet, he consistently demonstrates a willingness to communicate, share ideas, and engage with the public in ways that remain uncommon in local politics.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During his last campaign, Woody proactively reached out with a full campaign message and committed to a podcast-style interviewâ€”an uncommon level of outreach among local 
                    candidates. Since then, he has maintained ongoing communication with InformTheVoteNJ and has shared informal updates on township concerns such as the 393 Main Street 
                    issue, a recent meeting cancellation, and other developments that otherwise wouldnâ€™t be widely known.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So far in the 2025 cycle:
                    <ul>
                        <li>-He maintains a campaign website with issue-based messaging, though updates are sometimes slow to reflect new developments
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>-He has agreed to a new podcast-style interview and remains open to long-form discussion
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>He plans to hold a meet-and-greet, though final details are pending
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>-He has committed to participating in a candidate forum, pending coordination with the municipal clerk and opponent
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>-He sparingly attends Republican breakfasts, showing some visibility in party spaces but not as regularly as his opponent
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Importantly, he consistently attends Lawrence Township Committee meetings, demonstrating civic involvement and attention to current issues
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Compared to incumbent John Tisa, Woodyâ€™s campaign feels more accessible, more organized, and better suited to modern voter expectationsâ€”but still not fully complete. 
                    A more consistent update cycle for his website and more timely confirmation of public events would bring his transparency rating to the top tier.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For now, Charlie Woody earns an above-average transparency ratingâ€”recognized for his clear effort, ongoing engagement, and strong foundation for a fully open and 
                    accessible campaign.

                    <li><b>Transparency</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While I may be younger than my opponent, I have not lost sight of our town's rich history or the challenges we currently face. It is essential to prioritize transparency 
                    with our taxpayers. We must be diligent in tracking the allocation of funds and shining a light on our expenditures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is disheartening to witness the current committee's lack of transparency. Many residents are struggling to make ends meet, and some are at risk of losing their homes. 
                    The response of the current administration-"You should have shown up to a meetin"-is dismissive and fails to acknowledge the diverse work schedules of our community 
                    members. To foster an inclusive environment, I propose that our meetings be live-streamed, allowing those who cannot attend in person to participate meaningfully. 
                    Furthermore, I believe in the importance of creating a channel for residents to submit their questions via email so they can be addressed during meetings at their 
                    convenience. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our township website requires updated maintenance and user-friendly access. I commit to being available for any inquiries from my fellow neighbors, ensuring no one 
                    feels intimidated, as evidenced by inappropriate conduct displayed at the September 11, 2023, meeting.

                    <li><b>553</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The condition of 553 must be addressed; it poses significant safety risks to our residents. Rather than assigning blame for ownership, let's collaborate with the county 
                    to develop actionable plans that will restore our infrastructure and preserve the beauty of our beloved lake.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our children deserve safe and engaging spaces-alternatives to merely wandering the streets. I intend to partner with local organizations to create recreational 
                    facilities that will enrich our community without imposing additional burdens on taxpayers.

            <div class="experience can-sec">
                Direct quote from communication with Woody:
                <br>
                <br>
                Cedarville is more than just a place on a map; it's a tapestry of memories, experiences, and shared connections that shape who we are. For many, like myself, the 
                identification with Cedarville runs deep-rooted in family legacy, acts of kindness, and the kind of community spirit that makes a small town feel like home.
                <br>
                <br>
                I proudly claim Cedarville as my birthplace and lifelong residence. My understanding of the importance of community was nurtured by my grandfather, Norman Burns Jr. 
                As a ten-year-old, I stood beside him, carrying bags full of food to locals in need. Our family didn't have much to spare, but we understood the significance of 
                helping others in our community. I still remember those government cheese blocks and the large cans of peanut butter that brought sustenance during hard times. As we 
                made our rounds delivering food, our home often became the last stop before the day's end. Yet, even when our family was in need, we never hesitated to pass that last 
                bag of food to someone who required it more.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, our commitment to helping others continues as my family operates the local food pantry. The values instilled by my grandfather remain strong. In the past, our 
                family had teamed up to distribute Christmas gifts and festive baskets filled with candy and fruit-symbols of joy and generosity. However, reminiscent of my 
                childhood, I always received my gifts last, ensuring that others came first.
                <br>
                <br>
                Yet it wasn't only my grandfather who shaped my identity as a Cedarville resident. My father, an industrious man determined to provide for four children, worked 
                tirelessly, often sacrificing precious moments of father-son bonding. Nevertheless, through my grandfather's car dealership, I developed a special connection with 
                him, and many in our town fondly remember the cars purchased from his lot.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cedarville's charm also manifests in the simple joys of childhood. I remember swimming at Cedarville Lake and playing on the swings with my siblings, thanks to my 
                mother-a dedicated caregiver. My mother was the daughter of Norman and Hazel Burns, and her love and support was a key element in our family's fabric, creating 
                lasting memories of togetherness.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2004, my grandfather's passing marked a significant transition in my life as I inherited the family home. It's here that I raised my two wonderful children, now 
                aged 11 and 16. As a parent, I feel a responsibility to ensure they experience the same sense of community pride that I have. I want my children to feel the same 
                connection to Cedarville that I have felt, to be able to say, "You know you're from Cedarville when..." with a sense of belonging and pride.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, I stand committed to enhancing the spirit of Cedarville and bringing back the essence of our small-town roots while looking forward to the new possibilities 
                that lie ahead for Lawrence Township. As I embark on my campaign for the Lawrence Township Committee, I humbly ask for your support. I am dedicated to working hard 
                for my family, our neighbors, and those who will join our community in the future. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Mark your calendars for November 5th, 2024, and join us in shaping a future where Cedarville remains a vibrant place with a strong community spirit-a place where 
                generosity thrives, neighbors support one another, and we cherish the memories that make our home so special. After 17 years in office, it is time for fresh leadership. 
                I respectfully urge my opponent to step aside and allow a new generation to lead our town forward. Together, we can restore pride in our community and build a brighter 
                future for all residents.Together, let's ensure our children can proudly say, "I'm from Cedarville.""

                    As a lifelong resident of this remarkable town, my dedication has been shaped by years of active service, from volunteering at my family's food pantry to answering 
                    emergency 911 calls for our community over the past 17 years. In recognition of my commitment, I was honored in 2017 with a lifetime membership for my contributions to 
                    our town-a testament to my enduring connection to our neighbors and their needs.
