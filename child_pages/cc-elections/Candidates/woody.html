                  <p>          
    
                    Charlie Woody is a lifelong resident of Cedarville whose campaign focuses on community service, local pride, and practical problem-solving. His platform includes 
                    proposals for improving government transparency, cleaning up abandoned properties, addressing concerns over Route 553 and 393 Main Street, and creating safer spaces 
                    for children—all while emphasizing open communication and taxpayer accountability. With a campaign website, consistent township meeting attendance, and a commitment 
                    to participating in a public forum, Woody receives an above-average transparency rating. While there's still room to improve the frequency of updates and finalization 
                    of public events, his willingness to engage and address specific local concerns makes him one of the more accessible candidates in the county.

                  <h6 class="page-title">Charlie Woody</h6>
                  <p>          
    
                    Charlie Woody is a returning candidate for Lawrence Township Committee who has made a clear effort to raise the standard for local campaign transparency. While he hasn’t 
                    reached the top tier yet, he consistently demonstrates a willingness to communicate, share ideas, and engage with the public in ways that remain uncommon in local politics.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During his last campaign, Woody proactively reached out with a full campaign message and committed to a podcast-style interview—an uncommon level of outreach among local 
                    candidates. Since then, he has maintained ongoing communication with InformTheVoteNJ and has shared informal updates on township concerns such as the 393 Main Street 
                    issue, a recent meeting cancellation, and other developments that otherwise wouldn’t be widely known.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So far in the 2025 cycle:
                    <ul>
                        <li>-He maintains a campaign website with issue-based messaging, though updates are sometimes slow to reflect new developments
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>-He has agreed to a new podcast-style interview and remains open to long-form discussion
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>He plans to hold a meet-and-greet, though final details are pending
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>-He has committed to participating in a candidate forum, pending coordination with the municipal clerk and opponent
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>-He sparingly attends Republican breakfasts, showing some visibility in party spaces but not as regularly as his opponent
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Importantly, he consistently attends Lawrence Township Committee meetings, demonstrating civic involvement and attention to current issues
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Compared to incumbent John Tisa, Woody’s campaign feels more accessible, more organized, and better suited to modern voter expectations—but still not fully complete. 
                    A more consistent update cycle for his website and more timely confirmation of public events would bring his transparency rating to the top tier.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For now, Charlie Woody earns an above-average transparency rating—recognized for his clear effort, ongoing engagement, and strong foundation for a fully open and 
                    accessible campaign.

            <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
                <p>In this updated 2025 interview with <strong>InformTheVoteNJ.com</strong>, Lawrence Township Committee candidate <strong>Charlie Woody</strong> expands on his 
                    campaign platform, emphasizing transparency, accountability, youth engagement, and the urgent need for functional government. This follow-up builds on last 
                    year's interview, responding to new developments and his primary race against incumbent John Tisa.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Concerns About Leadership Attendance and Communication:</strong><br>
                Charlie raised early concerns about the absence of the current mayor from multiple township meetings and the lack of public notification. A particularly short 
                meeting with only one committeeman in attendance raised flags for him about unequal access to information. He questioned why only certain long-time residents 
                seemed aware that the meeting would be cut short, highlighting a lack of transparency and consistency in township communication.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Website Issues and Digital Transparency:</strong><br>
                Woody was blunt about the township’s poorly maintained website, citing outdated content, broken contact numbers, and a lack of public meeting minutes. He 
                criticized the $16,000 annual payment to CDC for web services (correction: it appears as though website maintenance is one of many services CDC provides) and 
                vowed to push for better accountability and, if needed, replacement of the vendor within 90 days if elected. He acknowledged that improvements have started, 
                but attributes them to public pressure, including his own vocal advocacy.</p>
        
                <p><strong>TextMyGov Rollout:</strong><br>
                While cautiously optimistic about the new “TextMyGov” platform, which will allow residents to text the clerk with concerns and receive alerts, Charlie noted 
                that it is an added expense—not a replacement for the website—and stressed the importance of evaluating its effectiveness before renewing the contract after 
                two years.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Transparency, Forums, and the “Good Ol’ Boys Club”:</strong><br>
                Charlie criticized opponent John Tisa for refusing to participate in interviews, forums, or sharing any campaign information at all... framing this as emblematic 
                of an insider political culture that hand-picks successors rather than allowing open competition. He recounted how Tisa initially pledged neutrality in last 
                year’s race but later supported Charlie’s opponent. Woody says this reveals a deeper issue in township politics: gatekeeping, loyalty-based endorsements, and a 
                lack of real dialogue with the public.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Financial Crisis and Calls for a Plan:</strong><br>
                Woody revealed that the township may be approaching bankruptcy, something he says residents were never formally told. He believes it’s unacceptable that the 
                public isn’t informed of such dire financial conditions and questions what Tisa has done during his term to address the situation. Woody emphasized the need 
                for a clear financial recovery plan and drew parallels to managing a failing business, arguing that elected officials must be held to a higher standard.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Rumors, Respect, and a Toxic Climate:</strong><br>
                Charlie directly addressed a rumor that he sabotaged a nonprofit's gaming license, strongly denying any involvement and framing it as politically motivated 
                misinformation. He condemned the spread of personal attacks and called for township leadership to denounce such behavior—regardless of whom it targets. He 
                stressed that he's willing to meet with anyone civilly, whether they support him or not, as long as the goal is to serve the township.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Youth Engagement and Community Building:</strong><br>
                In a shift toward constructive ideas, Woody proposed the creation of a skate park and other community spaces to re-engage youth and families. He also suggested 
                creating a summer internship for high school seniors interested in government, coordinated through the township and local schools. Woody emphasized that these 
                initiatives wouldn’t require raising taxes, pointing to available grants and unused resources as potential funding sources.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Local Civics, County Involvement, and Better Election Practices:</strong><br>
                Discussing broader civic issues, Woody supported InformTheVoteNJ’s push for civics education in schools, regular candidate information packets, and a greater 
                role for counties in helping voters learn about their choices. He agreed that the current candidate filing process lacks transparency and that voters should 
                have better access to biographical and qualification-based information about candidates.</p>

                <p><strong>Local Press and Civic Transparency:</strong><br>
                Charlie and the interviewer explored the lack of trustworthy, nonpartisan local press coverage. Charlie praised Steven Solof’s efforts with InformTheVoteNJ, 
                saying they’ve filled a critical gap in local political coverage. While acknowledging some progress—like efforts from Commissioner Director Sauro and 
                journalist Joseph Smith—he stressed that reliable, centralized reporting is still lacking. Charlie supports efforts to formalize candidate information 
                sharing and newsletters to keep residents informed year-round.</p>
                
                <p><strong>County Road 553 and Cedar Lake Dam:</strong><br>
                A major ongoing concern is the deteriorating condition of County Road 553, compromised by the failing Cedar Dam. Charlie explained the bureaucratic 
                finger-pointing between the township and the county over ownership responsibilities and repair costs. Although some sidewalk work was completed recently, 
                Charlie said county engineers have ignored multiple emails and calls for updates. He promised that if elected, his first 100 days would include getting 
                definitive answers and making them public. He stressed that taxpayers deserve more than silence and vowed to show up in person to get clarity.</p>
            
                <p><strong>393 Main Street Development:</strong><br>
                Turning to a more positive topic, Charlie described his evolution from skeptic to supporter of a new pool manufacturing facility at 393 Main Street. After 
                meeting with the owner, touring the facility, and reviewing environmental precautions—including upgraded smokestacks and sound barriers—Charlie praised the 
                company’s responsiveness and transparency. He posted the walkthrough video on his website, viewing the development as a net benefit for local ratables and 
                community relations.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Quarterly Newsletters and Meeting Agendas:</strong><br>
                Charlie endorsed the idea of township-run quarterly newsletters and consistent agenda postings. He recalled past efforts where residents received yearly 
                township updates and urged the return of these efforts. Charlie argued that regular communication—whether via printed flyers or digital formats—can reduce 
                misinformation and increase community participation in planning board meetings and decisions.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Bay Point Beach Project:</strong><br>
                Charlie also highlighted the $12 million Bay Point Beach renovation funded by a state grant. The project enhanced public access while preserving wildlife and 
                environmental safeguards. Although a ribbon-cutting ceremony has not yet occurred, he praised the work and invited residents to enjoy the improved waterfront area.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Election Integrity and Republican Party Friction:</strong><br>
                Charlie revisited last year’s election controversy, where he was initially certified the winner, only to have the certification rescinded days later due to 
                alleged tabulation errors involving mail-in ballots. He claims party leadership had already decided to back his opponent and that he was pressured to drop out, 
                even offered a spot on the Planning Board in exchange. Despite feeling politically sidelined, Charlie emphasized that he remains committed to serving all 
                residents, even those who dislike or oppose him.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Breaking the “Good Ol’ Boys Club”:</strong><br>
                Charlie framed his campaign as a grassroots effort against entrenched power, accusing current leadership of resisting change and transparency. He called for 
                fresh ideas and younger leadership, not out of rebellion, but out of necessity—pointing to financial mismanagement and outdated practices.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Personal Outreach and Mutual Aid Proposal:</strong><br>
                In closing, Charlie detailed how he has already helped township residents resolve heating emergencies, property complaints, and assistance applications—even 
                without holding office. He proposed donating 50% of his salary if elected to create a resident support fund for neighbors in need. This, he says, reflects his 
                philosophy of service: “I’m not running against the people—I’m running for them.”</p>

                    <li><b>Transparency</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While I may be younger than my opponent, I have not lost sight of our town's rich history or the challenges we currently face. It is essential to prioritize transparency 
                    with our taxpayers. We must be diligent in tracking the allocation of funds and shining a light on our expenditures.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is disheartening to witness the current committee's lack of transparency. Many residents are struggling to make ends meet, and some are at risk of losing their homes. 
                    The response of the current administration-"You should have shown up to a meetin"-is dismissive and fails to acknowledge the diverse work schedules of our community 
                    members. To foster an inclusive environment, I propose that our meetings be live-streamed, allowing those who cannot attend in person to participate meaningfully. 
                    Furthermore, I believe in the importance of creating a channel for residents to submit their questions via email so they can be addressed during meetings at their 
                    convenience. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our township website requires updated maintenance and user-friendly access. I commit to being available for any inquiries from my fellow neighbors, ensuring no one 
                    feels intimidated, as evidenced by inappropriate conduct displayed at the September 11, 2023, meeting.

                    <li><b>553</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The condition of 553 must be addressed; it poses significant safety risks to our residents. Rather than assigning blame for ownership, let's collaborate with the county 
                    to develop actionable plans that will restore our infrastructure and preserve the beauty of our beloved lake.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our children deserve safe and engaging spaces-alternatives to merely wandering the streets. I intend to partner with local organizations to create recreational 
                    facilities that will enrich our community without imposing additional burdens on taxpayers.

            <div class="experience can-sec">
                Direct quote from communication with Woody:
                <br>
                <br>
                Cedarville is more than just a place on a map; it's a tapestry of memories, experiences, and shared connections that shape who we are. For many, like myself, the 
                identification with Cedarville runs deep-rooted in family legacy, acts of kindness, and the kind of community spirit that makes a small town feel like home.
                <br>
                <br>
                I proudly claim Cedarville as my birthplace and lifelong residence. My understanding of the importance of community was nurtured by my grandfather, Norman Burns Jr. 
                As a ten-year-old, I stood beside him, carrying bags full of food to locals in need. Our family didn't have much to spare, but we understood the significance of 
                helping others in our community. I still remember those government cheese blocks and the large cans of peanut butter that brought sustenance during hard times. As we 
                made our rounds delivering food, our home often became the last stop before the day's end. Yet, even when our family was in need, we never hesitated to pass that last 
                bag of food to someone who required it more.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, our commitment to helping others continues as my family operates the local food pantry. The values instilled by my grandfather remain strong. In the past, our 
                family had teamed up to distribute Christmas gifts and festive baskets filled with candy and fruit-symbols of joy and generosity. However, reminiscent of my 
                childhood, I always received my gifts last, ensuring that others came first.
                <br>
                <br>
                Yet it wasn't only my grandfather who shaped my identity as a Cedarville resident. My father, an industrious man determined to provide for four children, worked 
                tirelessly, often sacrificing precious moments of father-son bonding. Nevertheless, through my grandfather's car dealership, I developed a special connection with 
                him, and many in our town fondly remember the cars purchased from his lot.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cedarville's charm also manifests in the simple joys of childhood. I remember swimming at Cedarville Lake and playing on the swings with my siblings, thanks to my 
                mother-a dedicated caregiver. My mother was the daughter of Norman and Hazel Burns, and her love and support was a key element in our family's fabric, creating 
                lasting memories of togetherness.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2004, my grandfather's passing marked a significant transition in my life as I inherited the family home. It's here that I raised my two wonderful children, now 
                aged 11 and 16. As a parent, I feel a responsibility to ensure they experience the same sense of community pride that I have. I want my children to feel the same 
                connection to Cedarville that I have felt, to be able to say, "You know you're from Cedarville when..." with a sense of belonging and pride.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today, I stand committed to enhancing the spirit of Cedarville and bringing back the essence of our small-town roots while looking forward to the new possibilities 
                that lie ahead for Lawrence Township. As I embark on my campaign for the Lawrence Township Committee, I humbly ask for your support. I am dedicated to working hard 
                for my family, our neighbors, and those who will join our community in the future. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Mark your calendars for November 5th, 2024, and join us in shaping a future where Cedarville remains a vibrant place with a strong community spirit-a place where 
                generosity thrives, neighbors support one another, and we cherish the memories that make our home so special. After 17 years in office, it is time for fresh leadership. 
                I respectfully urge my opponent to step aside and allow a new generation to lead our town forward. Together, we can restore pride in our community and build a brighter 
                future for all residents.Together, let's ensure our children can proudly say, "I'm from Cedarville.""

                <div class="experience can-sec">
                    As a lifelong resident of this remarkable town, my dedication has been shaped by years of active service, from volunteering at my family's food pantry to answering 
                    emergency 911 calls for our community over the past 17 years. In recognition of my commitment, I was honored in 2017 with a lifetime membership for my contributions to 
                    our town-a testament to my enduring connection to our neighbors and their needs.
