                Jim Sauro made the decision to return to county government as a team member 
                to provide the leadership Cumberland County needs to continue a path of improvement 
                and prosperity.  His experience in government policy and procedures and his deep 
                belief that Cumberland County is on the cusp of greatness once again are the reasons 
                he has returned as a candidate.
