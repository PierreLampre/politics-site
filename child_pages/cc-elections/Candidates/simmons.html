              <p>          

                Assemblywoman Heather Simmons brings over a decade of local government experience to the New Jersey General Assembly. She served four terms on the Gloucester County 
                Board of Commissioners, where she focused on economic development, infrastructure, workforce programs, and public services. As Deputy Director of the Board, she 
                launched a $15 million small business loan fund and led post-pandemic recovery efforts. Simmons holds degrees in international relations and public relations, and 
                currently serves as Vice President of Workforce Innovation and Partnerships at Rowan College of South Jersey. In the Assembly, she has sponsored a wide array of 
                legislation related to healthcare affordability, education, labor conditions, tax relief, and environmental protections.Capizola has been contacted multiple times 
                with opportunities to share updated information but has yet to provide a substantive response. Voters seeking detailed and current insights into his positions may 
                find it difficult to evaluate his candidacy without greater transparency.

              <h6 class="page-title">Heather Simmons</h6>
              <p>          

                While Assemblywoman Simmons has an extensive legislative record and a strong professional background, the lack of a centralized campaign website or clearly laid-out 
                public platform makes it difficult for everyday voters to grasp her goals, values, and positions without committing to deep research. While she is occasionally 
                visible on social media and has contributed a significant volume of sponsored legislation, she has not responded to outreach through official contact information, 
                nor has she made efforts to centralize voter education about her work.
                <br>
                <br>
                Given the volume of her legislative activity, her transparency rating may deserve a revision upward from a default “Low” to something closer to “Mixed” or “Moderate” 
                — recognizing the public availability of her record but noting the lack of direct communication, future platform clarity, and summarization of prior work.
                <br>
                <br>
                Note: While this is technically still the primary phase, both parties are running unopposed slates, meaning all four current candidates are expected to advance to the 
                general election. This creates a valuable opportunity for candidates to begin clearly communicating their platforms early, giving voters more time to learn and engage. 
                We encourage all candidates to take advantage of this head start by providing accessible, detailed information about their agendas and priorities.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, Simmons receives a below average to average rating for transparency and accessibility.

            <div class="experience can-sec">
                As of now, Assemblywoman Heather Simmons does not maintain a campaign website or formal public platform outlining her agenda for the 2025 election cycle. While her 
                legislative record provides some insight into her interests — including healthcare affordability, small business support, and workforce development — these topics 
                are pulled from past bills and do not constitute an official campaign agenda.
                <br>
                <br>
                In other words, while it's possible to speculate on her priorities based on the bills she has sponsored, voters deserve more than guesswork. It's up to candidates 
                to clearly and proactively communicate their plans — not up to voters to connect the dots. We encourage Assemblywoman Simmons to provide a formal platform so that 
                voters can make informed decisions without needing to piece it together from legislative history.

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Background and Experience</h4>
                <div class="experience can-sec">
                    Heather Simmons is a longtime public servant from Gloucester County with a background in both education and government. She currently serves in the New Jersey 
                    General Assembly, having taken office in 2024, following four terms as a Gloucester County Commissioner — including service as Deputy Director. She was the 
                    longest-serving woman in that role.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Professionally, Simmons has held leadership roles at Rowan College of South Jersey and Rowan University, focusing on workforce innovation, strategic planning, 
                    and institutional partnerships. She holds a bachelor’s degree in international relations and politics and a master’s degree in public relations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her public service resume includes involvement in economic development, workforce training, public infrastructure, and education. She has also served on 
                    regional planning and civic boards across South Jersey. In her short time in the Assembly, she has already sponsored a wide range of bills touching on 
                    healthcare, property tax relief, environmental regulation, and labor protections — indicating a broad policy interest.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That said, we still encourage the candidate to clearly communicate her agenda for this election cycle so that voters don’t need to rely on speculation or 
                    research to understand where she stands.
