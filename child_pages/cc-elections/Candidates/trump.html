              <p>
                Donald J. Trump was a career businessman who went into politics in 2015 and became president. He has been a highly controversial figure and he continues to be 
                scrutinized in this year's race. As the main focus of this site is on local politics and there is plenty of coverage on the presidential race, we recommend that 
                you follow it yourself. However, we have provided links to his sites, laid out his agenda, and provided a partial voting record for him below.
