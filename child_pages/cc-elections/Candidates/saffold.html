              <p>          

                Brandon Saffold brings a mix of lived experience and policy focus to his campaign for the NJ General Assembly. A military veteran and advocate for mental health reform, 
                Brandon’s campaign is rooted in personal struggles with New Jersey’s broken guardianship system, which inspired his proposed “Save Nina Act.” He aims to improve mental 
                health access, inspect failing psychiatric and rehab facilities with undercover teams, and ensure no resident is turned away from treatment. Brandon supports reproductive 
                rights, emphasizing safeguards that respect medical professionals over politicians. He supports transgender rights but proposes fairness-based 
                solutions for sports, like establishing separate divisions to maintain inclusivity and equity. On policing, Brandon acknowledges the need to rebuild trust, increase training, 
                and modernize expectations. He’s also passionate about reintroducing civics education, establishing a centralized, nonpartisan candidate platform, and ensuring real local 
                journalism exists. While not a career politician, he emphasizes transparency, cost-effectiveness, and a commitment to voting his conscience over party pressure.

              <h6 class="page-title">Brandon Saffold</h6>
              <p>          

                Brandon Saffold and Carolyn Rush are Democratic candidates for the New Jersey General Assembly in Legislative District 1. So far, their campaign shows clear signs of energy 
                and openness—but is still in the early-to-mid stages of becoming fully transparent and organized.
                <br>
                <br>
                They’ve launched a joint campaign website, which includes biographical information but does not yet provide written policy positions or a clearly articulated platform. 
                However, both candidates participated in a lengthy, in-depth 2.5 hour interview with InformTheVoteNJ, where they discussed numerous issues with a level of detail and 
                openness not often seen at this stage in a local campaign.
                <br>
                <br>
                They’ve also:
                <ul>
                    <li>-Agreed to follow-up interviews to further clarify positions
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>-Expressed willingness to participate in a public candidate forum alongside their primary opponent, Carol Sabo (though contact has not yet been established)
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Participated in at least one campaign event with gubernatorial candidate Steven Fulop, though the event was not widely advertised and was only discovered through 
                        personal social media connections
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <br>

                As it stands, Saffold and Rush come across as highly willing to engage, but it remains unclear how fully developed their campaign strategy and outreach efforts are. 
                There’s no obvious event calendar, limited messaging visibility beyond direct engagement, and no public repository of clear stances on core legislative issues—despite the 
                candidates demonstrating strong awareness of them in conversation.

                <br>
                <br>

                For these reasons, both candidates currently receive an average to above-average transparency rating, based on their direct engagement and willingness to participate in open 
                discussion. A fully developed public-facing platform—supported by consistent updates, better event promotion, and broader accessibility—would solidify them as top-tier in 
                transparency.
