              <p>
                Carole Cossaboon is the incumbent Millville City Commissioner, appointed in early 2025 to fill a vacancy and now running for a full term. A lifelong Millville resident, she has 
                over 30 years of experience working in public education as an administrative assistant at Holly Heights School and as a substitute teacher. She holds an associate degree in 
                education, a bachelor’s degree in sociology, and a graduate certificate in autism and behavior.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cossaboon has been active in a wide range of community organizations, including the Millville Elks, the Planning Board, the UEZ Board, and several civic and charitable boards and 
                clubs. She emphasizes accountability in local government, advocating for stricter enforcement on absentee landlords, more inspections of vacant properties, and cleaner, safer 
                neighborhoods as a foundation for economic development.
                <br>
                <br>
                Her platform focuses on addressing blight, improving code enforcement, and boosting public safety staffing to meet state standards. She also supports working with outside agencies 
                to attract businesses, writing grants for local programs, and learning from other communities to create opportunities in Millville.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cossaboon describes herself as approachable, candid, and respectful. As a registered Independent, she stresses that her only agenda is to work collaboratively with fellow 
                commissioners, regardless of party affiliation, to serve the city’s residents. She plans to continue attending community events, meeting directly with voters, and listening to 
                concerns as the election approaches.

              <h6 class="page-title">Carole Cossaboon</h6>
              <p>          

                As a sitting commissioner, Carole Cossaboon has demonstrated commendable transparency by responding to the candidate questionnaire early in the general election season. This 
                positions her ahead of the curve in terms of providing voters with clear information about her experience and priorities.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, this is a crowded race, and significant additional information and public engagement will likely emerge over the next several months. While Commissioner Cossaboon has 
                been responsive in written format, there has been no indication so far of interest in scheduling a radio interview or a more in-depth podcast closer to the election. These formats 
                are not mandatory, and candidates have every right to set their own campaign strategies and timing; however, because the opportunity was presented early and no plans were made, 
                it is important to note that this decision could impact public perception of accessibility later in the season.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, the early cooperation and thorough written responses reflect a positive level of transparency, with room to strengthen this further through more live or recorded 
                public-facing dialogue as the campaign progresses.

            <div class="experience can-sec">
                 I was elected to fill a vacant position that began in January of this year.   I am seeking re-election for a seat with Millville City Commission in the November election.  
                 I believe now as I did then  “now more than ever” our city needs a voice along with common sense judgement. Our city government needs to work together for one common goal, the 
                 future of  Millville and the citizens who call Millville their hometown.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                Having the opportunity to serve Millville for the past 7 months and interact with the citizens, the one point that is consistently brought to my attention is “the deplorable 
                conditions of our city and the crime rate. Sadly, poverty and unemployment lead to crime. My main goal is improving Millville by cleaning up our city. We need to take control of 
                the number of rentals we have allowed in our city. Currently, the percentage of occupied rental housing in Millville is 37.9%. Most of these 37.9% landlords do not live in Millville 
                or Cumberland County. We have absentee landlords who are not held accountable for their tenants or property. They have no clue how their tenants keep the property, nor do they 
                care how their unmaintained properties are affecting our city. Many rentals are vacant or boarded up. Improvements to the living conditions for the underprivilege should be the 
                same standard of living or rights as the majority of people in society have. We need to force landlords to hold renters accountable too. Are background checks being done on 
                prospective tenants? We need more boots on the ground, doing inspections and more often. Boarded up homes and vacant homes need to be either repaired within a reasonable time 
                limit or be torn down. By doing so, we are showing our community and residence we do care.

                <br>
                <br>

                As a current sitting commissioner, I listen to the citizens when they ask for help and work with them to find a solution.   I am approachable, have the ability to work with all 
                types of individuals, listening to both sides before giving a decision, speaking what is on my mind, with respect toward the other person.  The only agenda I have is to do what 
                is best for Millville and the citizens. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I may be short in stature, but I am big on respect for everyone.

                <br>
                <br>
                Having been a public employee in the education field for over thirty years, I have obtained valuable knowledge and experience which I feel would be beneficial for both taxpayers 
                of Millville and the current City Commissioners as well. I have the ability to view both sides of an issue, ask questions before giving a decision, as well as respect other’s 
                opinions whether I agree or disagree. I understand the diversity of our city and have gained the respect of the families and colleagues that I have interacted with throughout my 
                career. I can bring experience and time to invest in our city and work with this current commission and community to bring about positive changes for the city of Millville.
