              <p>
                Ms. Cossaboon has been a resident of Millville her whole life and has a wide range of relevant political experience including worked for the 
                Millville Board of Education for over 30 years, 'sitting as a board of director' for the for Shirley Eves Developmental Center, being the 
                Lodge Secretary for the Millville Elks, being the treasurer/negotiator/grievance chair for the Millville Education Association, and more.
                Her vision as a commissioner is to be an independent voice for common sense that will help bring unity to the board and accomplish goals for the 
                city such as attracting jobs at the industrial parks and airport, tackle the issue of absentee landlords, and demolish properties when 
                necessary.

                Quoted directly from communication with Candidate Cossaboon:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Create a relationship and work together as a team with both the residents and city commission to build a relationship of trust and openness 
                    between the two. Millville has the potential for attracting jobs with two industrial parks for building, an airport, and innovative ideas 
                    from potential businesses. If we want to show Millville is the city they should invest in, we also need to seek input from the necessary 
                    departments and the city solicitor to find ways to aggressively tackle the issue of absentee landlords neglecting their properties and take 
                    down the ones that need to be demolished. We need to work together for the betterment of Millville.

                      <br>
                      I have lived, worked, and raised my children in Millville for over fifty years. I have a BA in Sociology and a COG Study in Autism. 
                      Having worked thirty plus years for Millville Board of Education, spending thirty of those years at Holly Heights School. I have had the 
                      opportunity and privilege to work and interact with the families and children in Millville. I have a strong understanding of the 
                      diversity and issues that face the families in our city. My involvement with our city for over forty years include: developed and held 
                      weekly social skills group for autistic children, as well as being an advocate for the families for five years, volunteering in many 
                      organizations throughout our city from Little League and Babe Ruth baseball, PTA, Millville Marching Band, Little League World Series, 
                      sitting as a Board of Director for Shirley Eves Developmental Center, Church Vestry, Millville Soccer, and Holly Society of America, and 
                      Millville Elks as the Lodge Secretary and operating weekly bingo, which raises charitable funds that goes directly back to the community 
                      for city youth programs, sponsorships for sports leagues, handicap children, donating for those in need, and our vets.  I was actively 
                      involved with the Millville Education Association, serving as treasurer, negotiator, and grievance chair. Being an independent thinker 
                      and having a sense of humor will allow me the foresight to see both sides of the issue and work with those involved to reach an amicable 
                      decision.
