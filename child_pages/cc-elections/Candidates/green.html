              <p>
                Rachel Green is running for Millville City Commissioner on a platform emphasizing community engagement, public safety, economic growth, and education. Drawing on 
                decades of leadership in education, social justice advocacy, and organizational management, she frames her campaign around grassroots involvement and transparent 
                governance. Her agenda—adapted from her campaign’s “Opportunities” section—focuses on beautifying public spaces, fostering safer neighborhoods through 
                community-based policing, improving access to social and economic resources, revitalizing Millville’s economy, and expanding career and technical education 
                for students. While her campaign messaging highlights strong values of inclusivity and collaboration, it leaves some ambiguity about whether these priorities 
                are immediate community opportunities for involvement or future policy initiatives she intends to advance if elected.

                brief analysis from a “data collector / local reporter” point of view. 
                <!-- If you have an anchor or modal id, you can link it: <a href="#quick-summary">(jump)</a> -->

                quickly.</li>
            <li><b>Read the Transparency/Accessibility rating.</b> For a deeper look at how transparent the candidate has been (web presence, interviews, follow-ups, meet n greets) and 
                how communicative they've been in response to outreach, see the rating and its short explanation. This helps you understand what’s easy to find and who is easy to 
                contact.

            <li><b>Use the page as a multi-layered hub.</b> 
                If you 'just want the facts', stick to the source documents. If you want opinions about transparency, accessibility, and communication, check the transparency meter. 
                If you want coverage somewhere in between, like interviews that range from introductory to moderately pressing, watch the interviews. Choose your own adventure.</li>

                    <strong>Quick Summary</strong>
                </summary>
                Rachel Green is running for Millville City Commissioner on a platform emphasizing community engagement, public safety, economic growth, and education. Drawing on 
                decades of leadership in education, social justice advocacy, and organizational management, she frames her campaign around grassroots involvement and transparent 
                governance. Her agenda—adapted from her campaign’s “Opportunities” section—focuses on beautifying public spaces, fostering safer neighborhoods through 
                community-based policing, improving access to social and economic resources, revitalizing Millville’s economy, and expanding career and technical education 
                for students. While her campaign messaging highlights strong values of inclusivity and collaboration, it leaves some ambiguity about whether these priorities 
                are immediate community opportunities for involvement or future policy initiatives she intends to advance if elected.

                        <p>
                            Candidate <strong>Rachel Green</strong> introduces herself as a mother, wife, “GG,” and longtime community volunteer with a
                            Bachelor’s in Business Management and a Master’s in Public Administration. A former <em>school board president</em> in Gloucester
                            County, she frames her campaign around accessibility, listening, and putting residents over special interests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Green embraces being “the new girl” in Millville, arguing that tenure hasn’t delivered results and fresh leadership can.
                            Her platform centers on <strong>stronger South Jersey advocacy</strong>—collaborating with nearby mayors, pressing Trenton for attention
                            and resources—and practical local priorities: reliable transportation so residents can reach jobs, <strong>top-notch schools</strong>
                            with fully supported teachers and admins, revisiting the city <strong>master plan</strong>, and <strong>staffing the police force</strong> while pairing officers with
                            <strong>wraparound services</strong> (social workers, crisis help, basics like food and diapers) so public safety isn’t asked to be “everything.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She underscores <strong>year-round relationship-building</strong> (not just election-season photo-ops), trust through communication, and
                            the practical reality of Millville’s commission structure: voters must pick <strong>five people who can work together</strong>. Green is frank
                            that a single voice can’t move an agenda if consistently outvoted; cohesion and complementary values matter to get results.

                <strong>Explanation</strong>
            </summary>
            Rachel Green entered the Millville City Commission race with a solid early advantage in transparency. She launched a dedicated campaign website 
            and participated in an interview with J.T. Burks, immediately placing her above the local baseline where many candidates still rely on minimal 
            Facebook activity or unrecorded appearances. The decision to build a site at all—rather than treating social media as the only communication 
            channel—showed foresight and a respect for voters who prefer structured, easily navigable information.
            <br><br>
            Over the course of the campaign, Green maintained steady visibility. She attended the Four Seasons Forum, the InformTheVoteNJ Meet & Greet, 
            and likely the Housing Authority event. However, she seemingly opted to attend the No Kings rally rather than the recorded Candidates Forum, which was 
            the only opportunity this cycle for a public, on-the-record comparison between candidates. Her attendance choices suggest a prioritization of 
            broader community engagement over structured press formats—understandable, but strategically limiting from a transparency standpoint.
            <br><br>
            Her campaign website, while professionally presented, remained somewhat surface-level in its messaging. It effectively communicated values and 
            priorities, but stopped short of offering concrete policy detail or implementation plans. A follow-up long-form interview could have unpacked 
            these topics further—clarifying how her ideas would translate into action at City Hall. Without that deeper layer of dialogue, the campaign’s 
            messaging feels polished but thin, more about general direction than transformative plans ready on day one.
            <br><br>
            Her Facebook campaign page also saw little new substantive content in the final weeks before the election. While a Google search reveals another 
            interview and a few smaller media appearances, this illustrates a recurring problem seen with other candidates like Kott and Branin: when new 
            content isn’t shared directly with voter-information projects like InformTheVoteNJ, it risks getting lost in the noise of campaign season. 
            For voters trying to make informed decisions, accessibility isn’t just about producing content—it’s about ensuring that content is clearly 
            delivered and consolidated in places where people actually look for it.
            <br><br>
            Overall, Rachel Green’s campaign demonstrates strong presentation and a visible commitment to public engagement but stops short of full 
            transparency in the press sense—where clarity, depth, and direct media collaboration matter as much as event attendance.
            <br><br>
            Overall rating: A Bit Above Average (Stable) — strong start, consistent presence, and professional presentation, but limited depth and coordination 
            left her campaign more visible than truly transparent.
