              <p>
                
                Candidate Gomez is a lifelong Vineland resident who has worked on the Vineland Board of Ed as a supervisor for nearly 30 years, has 
                been the owner of Kingdom Finance for about 10 years, and has been operating a tax firm for nearly 10 years. He is the president of two
                non-profits, Kingdom Empowering Entrepreneur Network and Kingdom Covenant Ministry. He is the author of two books, serves on the 
                Hispanic Advisory Board of RCSJ, and is an ordained minister. He has joined Mayor Fanucci's 'Proven-Leadership Proven Results' ticket 
                in this election and hopes to continue the current administrations general agenda to keep the streets safe and create new developments. 
                With his experience in finance he hopes to bring his expertise to the city council, which would help bring financial literacy to the 
                community and help keep the cost of living the lowest in NJ. He also differentiates himself from the other candidates by being a lifelong 
                resident who went from a life of poverty to an established entrepreneur, so he will be able to relate to the cries of the less fortunate 
                and properly represent them in local government.

                The current administration has done an amazing job of renewing a sense of pride. I look to help continue the pride in the city and keep the 
                streets safe. With the City creating Growth and New developments I hope to bring information and financial literacy to the small companies 
                that are occupying store fronts in the City Vineland. I would like to help the current administration make informed and fiscal responsible 
                decisions to help the city maintain the lowest cost of living in NJ.

                The difference between myself and other City Council candidates is the fact that I have lived in the city my whole life through many 
                circumstances. From living in poverty to now being an established entrepreneur. I know the cries of those that are less fortunate and I 
                know the process that is essential in reaching purpose. I know how important information is and I will be able to carry their cries
                to the Council table and bring back necessary information. My spiritual convictions will also assure that we make conscious decisions.
