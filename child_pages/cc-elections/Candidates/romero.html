              <h6 class="page-title">Tony Romero</h6>
              <p>
                Commissioner Romero is up for re-election this year as the only person of color running at the county level. Being that he is an incumbent, he inherently has more 
                experience than his democrat challengers. Being of Cuban descent, he is particularly focused on standing against communism by upholding the constitution. He is also 
                particularly passionate about cutting red tape for businesses. Like most candidates at the local level, Romero seems to be running slate (as part of the overall republican 
                team) and there is little forward facing information about how he is directly different from his democrat challengers. He has been reached out to via his government email to
                clarify his individual stances and how he differentiates himself from his opponents, with no response. He was also asked in person about whether he received the email, to which
                he said he would look for it. At Deerfield Day, we asked his challenger Austino what his platform was, to which he expressed concerns about the commissioner board 
                potentially spending too much money on county parks, and when we cross-checked this with Romero, Romero said (paraphrased) "Those projects are within the county budget, 
                there's nothing to be concerned about." There was also an implicative claim on the campaign trail from his opponents that the South Ave Culvert project has not been 
                efficiently handled, but you can see that the county is in the process of handling it here,
                <a href="https://cumberlandcountynj.gov/press-releases/?FeedID=8553&fbclid=IwY2xjawF_oE9leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHWmML36E50OFvJDbFxaDr-dmK1TrZFrCpw10t1eb-y8YmkL0M-CycTeegw_aem_Bxr9sxoiH2wgxNCqr4Rk3A">County Press Release</a>.
                This could be part of Romero's running mates', Director Commissioner Sileo, often proposed claim that the historically Democrat controlled county has created a onion
                with many layers of problems, so projects such as the South Ave Culvert could be taking much longer than would normally be needed.

        <div class="agenda-thesis can-sec">
            After reaching out to multiple members of the CCRRO, it is not totally clear how the Republican party platform applies to Cumberland County. However, could infer 
            some of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Opposition to policy 5756 in the school system (the notorious 'Trans rights vs Parents rights' issue) suggests pushing for socially conservative values.

                </li>
                <li>Opposition to projects like a 50+ million dollar French Museum in Jersey City suggests prioritization on fiscal conservatism. 
                    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/arts/design/new-jersey-centre-pompidou-museum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="website-link">New York Times Article</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h4 class="sub-heading">policy positions</h4>
        <div class="policy-positions can-sec">
            To be clear, with the lack of a proper newspaper providing thorough, professional-level election coverage, both sides of the aisle in *local* 
            politics seem to be suffering from a lack of clear messaging. This is not to say that they aren't putting forward a lot of effort to message, 
            but the information is oftentimes scattered across the internet, spoken about at meetings/events that appear partisan or have expensive 
            sponsorship fees, or mentioned at lengthy meetings most people simply won't attend. Oftentimes people get brief literature like
            <details>
                <summary style="cursor:pointer; color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">View Screenshot</summary>
                        <p>If on desktop, right click the image and select 'open in new tab' for a larger image</p>

            </details>
            . They also might get vague impressions of what local Republicans or Democrats might believe based on what they know about national politics.
            While we have been able to gather some specific information about Romero's run for County Commissioner, as shown by the information above, there is probably a lot more 
            detail that we could go into about the specifics of the clerk's office and Romero's campaign bid.
            <br>
            <br>
            The one general point that the party has made clear regarding the local level, is that the Democrat party has been predominantly in control for 
            the past 40 odd years, and they have made a mess while doing so, so perhaps it is time to let the Republicans take control for a while so they 
            can clean it up.
