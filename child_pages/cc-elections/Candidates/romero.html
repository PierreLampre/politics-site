              <h6 class="page-title">Tony Romero</h6>
              <p>
                Commissioner Romero is up for re-election this year as the only person of color running at the county level. Being that he is an incumbent, he inherently has more 
                experience than his democrat challengers. Being of Cuban descent, he is particularly focused on standing against communism by upholding the constitution. He is also 
                particularly passionate about cutting red tape for businesses. Like most candidates at the local level, Romero seems to be running slate (as part of the overall republican 
                team) and there is little forward facing information about how he is directly different from his democrat challengers. He has been reached out to via his government email to
                clarify his individual stances and how he differentiates himself from his opponents, with no response. He was also asked in person about whether he received the email, to which
                he said he would look for it. Click the x at the top red of this box to go back to the page.

        <h4 class="sub-heading">party messaging</h4>
        <div class="agenda-thesis">
            After reaching out to multiple members of the CCRRO, it is not totally clear how the Republican party platform applies to Cumberland County. However, could infer 
            some of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Opposition to policy 5756 in the school system (the notorious 'Trans rights vs Parents rights' issue) suggests pushing for socially conservative values.

                </li>
                <li>Opposition to projects like a 50+ million dollar French Museum in Jersey City suggests prioritization on fiscal conservatism. 
                    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/arts/design/new-jersey-centre-pompidou-museum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="website-link">New York Times Article</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>                

        <h4 class="sub-heading">policy positions</h4>
        <div class="policy-positions">
            After reaching out to Commissioner Romero and not receiving a response, it is unclear what specific policy positions relevant to Cumberland County 
            he has moving forward. However, we can infer some of the following having paid attention a fair amount over the past year:
            <ul>
                <li>Romero voted no to proceed with the Middle Mile Broadband Project. In his explanation he gave reasons regarding the cost and management of the project, 
                    which he said was informed by his years of experience in the cable broadband industry. This suggests he will error on the side of fiscal conservatism and 
                    sound business management.

                </li>
                <li>
                    While Romero might not have addressed any specific policy positions regarding social issues in Cumberland County, he has made some comments at breakfast meetings 
                    which suggest he would move in the direction of socially conservative values.
