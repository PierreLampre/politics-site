              <h6 class="page-title">Tony Romero</h6>
              <p>
                Commissioner Romero is up for re-election this year as the only person of color running at the county level. Being that he is an incumbent, he inherently has more 
                experience than his democrat challengers. Being of Cuban descent, he is particularly focused on standing against communism by upholding the constitution. He is also 
                particularly passionate about cutting red tape for businesses. Like most candidates at the local level, Romero seems to be running slate (as part of the overall republican 
                team) and there is little forward facing information about how he is directly different from his democrat challengers. He has been reached out to via his government email to
                clarify his individual stances and how he differentiates himself from his opponents, with no response. He was also asked in person about whether he received the email, to which
                he said he would look for it. Click the x at the top red of this box to go back to the page.
