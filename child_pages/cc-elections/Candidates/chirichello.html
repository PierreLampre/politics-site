                As of 7/8/2025, we still don't have any information on this candidate. As a reminder, we reach out through information obtained through whichever clerk's office 
                is appropriate, basic google searches, and public comments at appropriate governmental meetings. In other words, a lack of information on this site should not be 
                perceived as a lack of effort on our part, we simply haven't received anything yet.

            <li><b>Read the Transparency/Accessibility rating.</b> For a deeper look at how transparent the candidate has been (web presence, interviews, follow-ups, meet n greets) and 
                how communicative they've been in response to outreach, see the rating and its short explanation. This helps you understand what’s easy to find and who is easy to 
                contact.

                If you 'just want the facts', stick to the source documents. If you want opinions about transparency, accessibility, and communication, check the transparency meter. 
                If you want coverage somewhere in between, like interviews that range from introductory to moderately pressing, watch the interviews. Choose your own adventure.</li>

                    <strong>Quick Summary</strong>
                </summary>
                <p>
                    Ronny Chirichello is a first-time candidate for the Lawrence Township Board of Education. A small-business owner and 
                    relatively new Cumberland County resident (just over two years), he frames his candidacy around teacher support, 
                    fiscal responsibility, transparency, and creating a safe, positive learning environment.
                    <br><br>
                    Chirichello highlights his business experience managing budgets, solving problems, and making tough decisions as a 
                    foundation for careful school budgeting and oversight. Although new to public office, he emphasizes a willingness 
                    to “step up when it matters” and a long-term commitment to the community and its only school.
                    <br><br>
                    His agenda focuses on broad governance priorities rather than detailed issue-by-issue stances: supporting students 
                    and teachers, providing regular updates and open forums for parents and residents, reviewing budgets for waste, 
                    and strengthening anti-bullying measures and facility upkeep to ensure a safe, respectful learning environment. 
                    Specific positions on current district controversies or priorities were not provided.

                <strong>Explanation</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
                Dan Dixon has taken meaningful steps to make himself accessible and transparent as a candidate for Millville City Commission. His campaign website goes further than most of his peers by outlining his platform in detail, giving voters a clear sense of his priorities and values. He has also scheduled a meet-and-greet in the coming weeks, signaling a willingness to show up in person and take questions directly from the community. When I spoke with him by phone, he was responsive and straightforward: he acknowledged my questionnaire, explained he needed more time to prepare thoughtful answers, and made it clear he intends to follow through before moving into interviews.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                That balance—having some strong public-facing materials while also asking for a little breathing room on deeper questions—puts Dixon in a position that is better than average, but still shy of the highest standard. And to note, the overwhelming amount of candidates in the county don’t reach top tier, because recent elections have raised the bar. Whether it’s Donald Trump doing a 3-hour podcast or Steven Fulop outlining 70 pages of policy, there are possibilities that go beyond the status quo of local politics. That being said, Dixon’s approach strongly suggests a candidate who values transparency and accessibility but is taking his time to make sure he does it the right way. In a county where voters too often get surface-level campaign blurbs, even this level of preparation already moves him into the “above average” category.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                The question is what happens next. If Dixon follows through on his plan to complete the questionnaire, sit for interviews, and keep building a two-way channel with the public, he could easily rise into the top tier of transparency. The groundwork is there: he’s already engaging online, scheduling in-person events, and picking up the phone when asked. The next step is checking the remaining “beyond status quo” boxes. Sometimes it’s not about the individual candidate, but pushing the county towards a higher standard.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                For now, Dixon earns an above-average transparency rating, with clear momentum toward the top tier. If he keeps building on what he has started, he could set a new expectation for what candidate accessibility looks like in Millville.

                        classroom-level support.

                        updates and open forums that involve the entire community in understanding how policies are set and 
                        implemented.

                        well-maintained facilities, aiming for day-to-day school operations that help students feel 
                        supported and ready to learn.

        <p><strong>Dear Community Members,</strong></p>

        <p>
            My name is Ronny Chirichello. I’ve lived in Cumberland County a little over two years, and while I may be newer to the area, I’ve quickly 
            come to care deeply about our community and the success of our one school. I own and operate my own business, which has given me real 
            experience managing budgets, solving problems, and making the kind of tough decisions that keep things moving forward. This is my first 
            run for public office, but I’ve always believed in stepping up when it matters.
        </p>

        <p><strong>If elected, my priorities are simple and focused:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Support for Students &amp; Teachers</strong> – Strong schools are built on both. I’ll work to make sure teachers have the resources they need so students don’t fall behind.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency &amp; Communication</strong> – Parents and residents deserve to know what’s happening in the school and how decisions are made. I want regular updates and open forums that include the whole community.</li>
            <li><strong>Fiscal Responsibility</strong> – Every tax dollar matters. I’ll review budgets carefully, question wasteful spending, and make sure funds go where they benefit kids most.</li>
            <li><strong>Safe, Positive Learning Environment</strong> – Our kids can’t learn if they don’t feel safe or supported. I’ll support stronger anti-bullying measures, well-maintained facilities, and programs that build respect and inclusion.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I may be new to Cumberland County, but I’m here for the long haul. I care about this town, our families, and especially our children’s 
            future. I’m ready to listen, work hard, and do whatever it takes to make sure our school is a place where every student can succeed.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            With respect,<br>
            <strong>Ronny Chirichello</strong><br>
            Candidate for Lawrence Twp. School Board
