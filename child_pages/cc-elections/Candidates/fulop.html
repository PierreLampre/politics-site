              <p>          

                Steven Fulop is a three-term mayor of Jersey City and a Marine Corps veteran running for Governor of New Jersey with a platform grounded in bold, practical 
                reform. Known for turning around Jersey City after the largest corruption scandal in the state's history, Fulop has built a reputation for transparency, 
                innovation, and hands-on leadership. Under his administration, Jersey City became a statewide leader in housing production, environmental sustainability, 
                public safety reform, and fiscal responsibility—all while expanding services and holding the line on taxes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Fulop’s statewide platform reflects his executive experience: he's pushing for real solutions to affordability through tax reform, expanded housing access, 
                shared services, and regional consolidation. His agenda includes comprehensive plans to modernize transportation, fix the broken school funding formula, 
                protect the environment, expand healthcare access, and end entrenched political corruption—especially the influence of party bosses and the county line 
                ballot system. Fulop is presenting himself as a candidate who doesn’t just talk about change—he’s already done it at the local level and is ready to scale 
                that leadership statewide.

                Steven Fulop brings real-world executive experience to public safety, having led Jersey City through active shooter events, the COVID-19 pandemic, and a 
                period of national unrest around policing. As mayor, he implemented community-focused reforms that made Jersey City a national model for police diversity and
                accountability. His administration reduced homicides and shootings to multi-year lows while expanding alternatives to incarceration, like community court, 
                drug treatment, and mental health programs. He also created New Jersey’s largest reentry initiative and pioneered civilian oversight, body camera mandates, 
                and de-escalation training.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                As Governor, Fulop plans to replicate these successes statewide. He’ll crack down on repeat offenders with targeted prosecution, reform bail to prevent 
                premature releases, and restore cost-of-living increases for retired public workers. His agenda includes eliminating public defender fees, expanding 
                restorative justice, closing youth prisons, and mandating active shooter readiness and Ceasefire Units in high-crime areas. Fulop also supports raising the 
                firearm purchase age to 21, enforcing tougher gun laws, and increasing accountability for law enforcement leadership—all backed by technology and policy 
                reforms aimed at making communities safer and more just.

                    Steven Fulop’s transportation plan is rooted in hands-on experience modernizing Jersey City’s transit systems and a vision for restoring New Jersey’s 
                    status as a national leader in mobility. As mayor, he launched the region’s first public micro-transit program, expanded bike infrastructure, eliminated 
                    traffic deaths on city-owned streets through Vision Zero, and invested in ferry and greenway access. He also restructured commuter garage fees to benefit 
                    transit users and prioritized equity by reaching underserved communities with affordable rideshare services. These local successes shape his statewide 
                    approach.

                    <br>
                    As Governor, Fulop would push for dedicated NJ TRANSIT funding, expand light rail, modernize PATH with a goal of transferring oversight to NJ TRANSIT, 
                    and support smart congestion pricing to fund transit—not just NYC infrastructure. His plan includes closing transit deserts through state-run 
                    micro-transit, fully funding the Hudson-Essex Greenway, modernizing stations, protecting transit workers, and demanding more accountability from the Port 
                    Authority. He also proposes sweeping changes to the MVC to improve service and efficiency. Fulop’s vision centers on equity, sustainability, modernization, 
                    and statewide investment that meets New Jersey’s dense, evolving needs.

                    Steven Fulop recognizes New Jersey’s affordable housing crisis as one of the greatest threats to economic stability, health, and equity across the state. 
                    As mayor of Jersey City, he led efforts that produced thousands of affordable and market-rate units, including the transformative Bayfront project with 
                    35% affordability, and passed Right to Counsel protections for tenants. He also pioneered zoning innovations like the Affordable Housing Overlay Zone 
                    (AHOZ) and created new public housing despite national restrictions. Fulop understands that stable housing is the foundation for upward mobility, health, 
                    and neighborhood safety, and he plans to bring this integrated approach to the state level.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As Governor, Fulop would double the state’s affordable housing production and implement statewide Right to Counsel, permanent deed restrictions on 
                    affordability, and equitable transit-oriented development. He would reform tax credit systems, incentivize accessory dwelling units (ADUs), and streamline 
                    approval timelines to fast-track construction. His plan prioritizes racial equity, stronger tenant protections, local empowerment, and better use of state 
                    trust funds. With policies that address both housing supply and systemic barriers, Fulop proposes a comprehensive solution rooted in experience and backed 
                    by a proven track record.

                    Steven Fulop brings a hands-on approach to health and human services, with a track record of proactive leadership in Jersey City. As mayor, he expanded 
                    access to healthy food, housing for the homeless, women's health services, and senior care—often building unique partnerships and creating new city 
                    divisions to meet specific needs. His administration led New Jersey in decriminalizing marijuana, reducing veteran homelessness, and establishing the 
                    state’s first municipal prisoner re-entry program. Fulop also implemented domestic violence intervention programs, expanded early childhood resources, 
                    and made Jersey City a national model for vertical farming and food equity.

                    <br>
                    As Governor, Fulop plans to expand paid family leave, streamline subsidies for new parents, reform child care funding, and eliminate barriers to early 
                    intervention services. His agenda prioritizes mental health access, senior care reform, medical debt relief, and integration of public health systems. 
                    He proposes banning zip-code-based health insurance premiums, expanding access to abortion services, and reviewing hospital consolidation to protect 
                    patients over profits. With a focus on compassion, efficiency, and equity, Fulop aims to overhaul New Jersey’s fragmented health systems and make 
                    essential services more accessible for all residents.

                    Steven Fulop has a strong record of supporting education in Jersey City, despite limited municipal control over schools. He facilitated the construction 
                    of new school facilities through creative partnerships, expanded access to vocational training and inclusive programs for special needs students, and 
                    absorbed millions in city costs to ease the school budget burden. His administration made record investments in libraries, eliminated overdue fees, 
                    and supported both public and charter school expansion to give families real options. Fulop has also backed youth development programs, summer camps, 
                    and special education inclusion efforts as part of a holistic strategy to support children.

                    <br>
                    As Governor, Fulop plans to modernize New Jersey’s school funding formula, invest in universal Pre-K, confront school segregation, and expand mental 
                    health support for students. He would cap tuition increases at public universities, overhaul the college savings system, and realign state aid to better 
                    support community colleges and low-income students. His administration would also reform special education funding, expand recovery high schools, support 
                    shared services and district consolidation, and push for infrastructure upgrades. Fulop’s education vision emphasizes transparency, equity, affordability,
                    and preparing students for diverse pathways beyond high school.

                    Steven Fulop has built a record in Jersey City centered on transparency, efficiency, and reducing political corruption. As mayor, he enacted campaign finance 
                    reform, ended tax abatements for market-rate projects, and implemented participatory budgeting to give residents a voice in how funds are spent. He opposed 
                    the controversial Election Transparency Act, has consistently advocated for abolishing the county line ballot design, and championed ranked choice voting. 
                    Under his leadership, Jersey City consolidated overlapping departments, expanded shared services with schools and neighboring towns, and processed over 
                    5,000 OPRA requests annually with minimal complaints—showcasing a commitment to open government.

                    <br>
                    As governor, Fulop plans sweeping reforms at the state level: ending the county line, modernizing financial disclosures, banning zip-code-based health 
                    premiums, restoring pay-to-play restrictions, and establishing robust conflict-of-interest rules for party chairs. He would expand voter access with 
                    same-day registration and standardized ballot initiatives, increase legislative transparency, and push for term limits. Fulop’s administration would 
                    streamline public records processes, restructure how elections are managed across counties, and demand a more accountable budget process in Trenton. 
                    His approach signals a deep commitment to restoring public trust through practical, enforceable reforms.

                    As Mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop led one of the most environmentally progressive city administrations in the country—investing heavily in clean 
                    transportation, tree planting, green infrastructure, and electric vehicle charging stations. His city pioneered New Jersey’s first municipal microgrid, 
                    banned plastic bags ahead of the state, launched the largest municipal microtransit program in the U.S., and built over 25 miles of protected bike lanes. 
                    Fulop also developed Jersey City’s Climate Action Plan with aggressive 2030 benchmarks and implemented policies such as stormwater ordinances, 
                    green building incentives, and a $70 million investment in park and open space renovations.

                    <br>
                    As Governor, Fulop pledges to act urgently on climate and sustainability—eschewing distant 2050 goals for near-term action. His plan includes a 
                    moratorium on warehouse development until statewide environmental guidelines are established, a major upgrade to the state’s electric vehicle 
                    infrastructure, and a 7% statewide energy efficiency target (up from 2%). He would fully support offshore wind, restore Department of Environmental 
                    Protection staffing to pre-Christie levels, end the bear hunt, and protect Liberty State Park from privatization. Fulop’s administration would also 
                    prioritize clean air and water enforcement, expand state parkland, and strengthen environmental justice protections by holding polluters accountable 
                    and ensuring green infrastructure reaches underserved communities.

                    As Mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop stabilized taxes, phased out excessive developer tax abatements, and implemented strong financial management 
                    systems, leading to multiple years of flat or reduced municipal tax rates. He introduced participatory budgeting, green financing, and outcome-based 
                    budgeting, helping residents directly influence spending while maintaining fiscal discipline. Fulop also created the Department of Finance, increased 
                    budget transparency, and launched a tax stabilization program praised by Moody’s. His administration avoided gimmicks, prioritized long-term planning, 
                    and invested in sustainable infrastructure while reducing reliance on unpredictable revenues.

                    <br>
                    As Governor, Fulop plans to overhaul the state’s affordability approach by targeting regressive and overly complex tax relief programs. He proposes 
                    reforms to the Stay NJ property tax plan, advocates for circuit breaker-style tax credits tied to income, and supports targeted relief for renters and 
                    low-income seniors. Fulop also calls for stronger ethics laws to combat what he calls a “corruption tax,” municipal debt reform requiring voter 
                    referendums, and regional service consolidation to cut costs. He would introduce a graduated mansion tax, restructure income taxes for high earners, 
                    pursue unfunded mandate reform, and challenge New York’s “convenience of the employer” tax rule to protect New Jersey workers. His platform aims to 
                    reduce structural inefficiencies while expanding affordability across housing, services, and taxation.
