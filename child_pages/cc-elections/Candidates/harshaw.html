              <h6 class="page-title">Albert Harshaw</h6>
              <p>
                Albert Harshaw is a Republican candidate for US Senate. He is a highly decorated military vet with
                    who was an international business law major and is certified in maritime law. He has very detailed information on his site regarding not only
                    his specific policy ideas, but also how he plans on achieving those policy ideas. His policy proposals range from rebuilding manufacturing, 
                    agriculture, and overall infrastructure, to investing in childhood education, re-entering the space race, bringing accountability to government
                    corruption, reforming the tax code, and more. Harshaw was also very prompt and thorough while communicating with Inform the Vote. During a phone 
                    interview, Harshaw differentiated himself from other candidates by saying he has been developing his policies for years while 
                    other candidates are 'Johnny come latelys'.
