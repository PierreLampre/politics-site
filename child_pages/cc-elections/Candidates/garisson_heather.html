              <p>          

                Heather Garrison is a long-time Millville resident and community builder running for City Commissioner.  
                She has been active in the PTA and local events for years and currently works for the Holly City Development 
                Corporation on community, economic, and housing initiatives.  
                In a brief “man on the street” interview she emphasized her belief in the power of community, a desire to 
                highlight Millville’s positives, and a commitment to make residents feel safe, heard, and included.  
                While this shows openness to engagement, detailed policy positions and a full platform have not yet been provided.

              <h6 class="page-title">Heather Garrison</h6>
              <p>          
                <p>
                Relative to the Millville status quo, Heather Garrison’s transparency and accessibility is rated 
                <strong>Average (Trending Upwards)</strong>. She has made herself available for a brief “man on the street” 
                interview, offering a glimpse of her background and campaign message about community-driven change.  
                However, voters looking for a fuller picture of her priorities will find limited detail beyond these 
                initial statements.  
                <br><br>
                To move toward a stronger rating, Garrison could publish a comprehensively detailed platform on a dedicated 
                website, host well-advertised meet-and-greet events where residents can ask questions, and participate in 
                one or more longer-form campaign or press interviews to unpack her message in depth.

                <p>          

                Heather Garrison is a long-time Millville resident and community builder running for City Commissioner.  
                She has been active in the PTA and local events for years and currently works for the Holly City Development 
                Corporation on community, economic, and housing initiatives.  
                In a brief “man on the street” interview she emphasized her belief in the power of community, a desire to 
                highlight Millville’s positives, and a commitment to make residents feel safe, heard, and included.  
                While this shows openness to engagement, detailed policy positions and a full platform have not yet been provided.

                    In this quick “Man on the Street” chat from the Millville Car Show, InformTheVoteNJ talks with Heather Garrison, a candidate for Millville City Commissioner. Garrison shares how the event reflects the community’s energy and explains why she’s running: to highlight Millville’s positive side, change negative narratives, and help shape a safer, more inclusive city. She also gives a snapshot of her background — 22 years living in Millville, raising six children through the public schools, active PTA involvement, and her current work as a Community Builder at Holly City Development Corporation focusing on community and economic development. Whether or not she wins a commission seat, Garrison says she’ll keep working to ensure residents feel safe, heard, and included in shaping their town’s future.

                Heather Garrison frames her campaign around the power of community. She says she has witnessed 
                residents rally together for positive change and wants to highlight the good that already exists in Millville. 
                Her goal is to help shift the narrative from negativity to possibility—showing that Millville can be 
                a safe and vibrant place to live, work, and raise a family.

                Relative to the Millville status quo, Heather Garrison’s transparency and accessibility is rated 
                <strong>Average (Trending Upwards)</strong>. She has made herself available for a brief “man on the street” 
                interview, offering a glimpse of her background and campaign message about community-driven change.  
                However, voters looking for a fuller picture of her priorities will find limited detail beyond these 
                initial statements.  
                <br><br>
                To move toward a stronger rating, Garrison could publish a comprehensively detailed platform on a dedicated 
                website, host well-advertised meet-and-greet events where residents can ask questions, and participate in 
                one or more longer-form campaign or press interviews to unpack her message in depth.
