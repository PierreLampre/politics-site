              <h6 class="page-title">Kamala Harris</h6>
              <p>
                Kamala Harris is a former District Attorney prosecutor, a former California Attorney General, a former US Senator, and is the current Vice President of the United States. 
                She was recently nominated as the presidential candidate deep into campaign season after concerns about President Biden's mental acuity finally hit a tipping point after 
                his debate against Trump. As of today 9/2/2024, it is still unclear what her specific agenda will be for president, as there is not an agenda on her 
                <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/">campaign site</a>. We don't want to speculate too 
                much, as the primary focus of this site is on local politics, so if you want a comprehensive analysis of the presidential candidate, we suggest you do the research, as 
                national politics is well-covered. That being said, we will provide some information that is available and that has trickled through some sources.
                One might infer that she will continue her general left leaning record, adopt many policies from the <a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/">*2020* Democrat platform</a>, 
                and follow through on some of the issues she mentioned at her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erkb4o6drDI">Atlanta Campaign Speech</a>. Some such mentioned issues 
                were border security, affordable healthcare, equal opportunity, the high cost of living, corporate landlords having high rents, prescription drug prices, universal 
                background checks and red flag laws concerning gun control, voting rights, and reproductive rights. The most specific points were in regards to voting rights, by mentioning 
                reintroducing the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2747">Freedom to Vote Act</a> and the 
                <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4">John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act</a> to congress. She has also mentioned some fiscal policy,
                such as giving a $6,000 child tax credit and $25,000 for individual home buyers.

                    With the abrupt change in switching out Biden for Harris as the Democrat nominee for president, it is not totally clear what her specific agenda is, as there is 
                    nothing officially posted on her campaign site yet. However, one might infer that she 
                    will continue her general left leaning record, adopt many policies from the <a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/">Democrat platform</a>, and follow 
                    through on some of the issues she mentioned at her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erkb4o6drDI">Atlanta Campaign Speech</a>. Some such mentioned issues were 
                    border security, affordable healthcare, equal opportunity, the high cost of living, corporate landlords having high rents, prescription drug prices, universal background 
                    checks and red flag laws concerning gun control, voting rights, and reproductive rights. The most specific points were in regards to voting rights, by mentioning

                    <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4">John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act</a> to congress. Hopefully after the initial fundraising 
                    and Vice Presidential nomination process of the past several weeks, an official agenda getting into more direct methods will be officially posted.
