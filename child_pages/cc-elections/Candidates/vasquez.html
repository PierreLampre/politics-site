                <h6 class="page-title">Luz Vasquez</h6>
                <p>
                <strong>Luz Vasquez</strong> is a Vineland School Board candidate, lifelong Vineland resident and VHS graduate, parent, and a 
                professional with a master’s in human services. For years she has regularly attended Board of Education meetings—often following up 
                directly with administrators—so voters can expect a blend of <em>watchdog persistence</em> and <em>positive championing</em> if elected.
                <br>
                <br>
                Her platform is organized around <em>Educate · Empower · Equip</em>:
                <em>Educate</em> (tighten academics and keep materials age‑appropriate in a safe learning environment),
                <em>Empower</em> (parents, students, and staff should be able to raise concerns without fear; prefer internal resolution while 
                respecting teacher voice), and
                <em>Equip</em> (align programs and resources so graduates are truly ready for next steps).
                <br>
                <br>
                Priority areas discussed in her September 2025 WVLT 92.1 interview include: (1) <strong>Budget transparency</strong>—plain‑English 
                summaries, handouts, and links so the public can actually follow along; (2) <strong>Graduation readiness</strong>—she cites an 
                <strong>86.3%</strong> graduation rate vs. a state range around <strong>91–95%</strong> and aims for <strong>95–100%</strong>, 
                emphasizing fundamentals, time‑on‑task, and better pacing; (3) <strong>Safety</strong>—armed security, staff training 
                (including awareness of gang dynamics), and tighter entry/door protocols; (4) <strong>Attendance & truancy</strong>—stronger 
                parent–school bridge, social‑service coordination, and early follow‑ups when flags appear; and (5) 
                <strong>Staff culture</strong>—ensure educators can speak up without retaliation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Note: a recent public meeting referenced ~<strong>35%</strong> <em>math readiness</em>; we’ll continue to follow up on how that metric 
                relates to the graduation‑rate figure Vasquez referenced (86.3%). In a live call‑in, she also declined to pre‑commit on a potential 
                superintendent contract vote, redirecting to her platform and a process‑driven approach.
                <br>
                <br>
                While the race is non‑partisan, Vasquez identifies as conservative and stresses parent involvement and clear communication. This 
                summary reflects her August 2025 questionnaire plus her September 2025 radio interview.

                <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
                <h6 class="page-title">Luz Vasquez</h6>
                <p>
                <strong>Status:</strong> <em>Above Average</em> for Cumberland County’s baseline.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Why:</strong> Vasquez submitted a structured response to our questionnaire (background, agenda, issue stances) and then 
                completed a ~1 hour on‑air interview that covered specifics (budget readability, security practices, attendance/truancy mechanics, 
                graduation‑rate targets). She has a multi‑year track record of attending BOE meetings and doing post‑meeting follow‑ups, which signals 
                accessibility and persistence beyond campaign season. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Areas for further detail (to match best‑practice transparency):</strong>
                No centralized campaign website yet (Facebook + Instagram are active). Some priorities are still described at a high level 
                (e.g., which budget visuals, which readiness benchmarks, which security‑protocol changes). No formal public campaign events are 
                listed so far.
                <br><br>
                <em>Note on ratings & the local status quo:</em> Not being at the very top of the transparency scale shouldn’t be taken personally; 
                it often reflects countywide norms. In 2025, detailed campaign sites, long‑form interviews, open meet‑and‑greets, and centralized 
                source hubs should be standard—but they’re not necessarily standard county-wide. Our scale is meant to encourage that norm, not punish 
                candidates.
                As of 9/4/2025, her campaign has been the most transparent and accessible in this race, with one other candidate on a seemingly similar 
                path. With ongoing discussions in the political scene regarding campaign strategies, and general time/resource management in all areas 
                of life, Luz may not need to do much more this year in relation to this project. But the door is open to dig in deeper if desired.                
                <br><br>
                As always, this rating is <em>dynamic</em> and relative to local norms, not a policy endorsement. We’ll update as new evidence comes in. Click the red <strong>x</strong> to close and scroll for sources.

                        <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;"> <p>In this ~56-minute radio interview, Vineland School Board candidate <strong>Luz Vasquez</strong> 
                            joins InformTheVoteNJ.com’s Steven Solof on WVLT 92.1 to discuss her background, long-standing watchdog role at board meetings, and a platform organized 
                            around <em>Educate, Empower, Equip</em>. The conversation covers budget transparency, school safety (including gang dynamics and building security), attendance 
                            and truancy, and graduation readiness.</p>

                            <p><strong>Background & Watchdog Perspective:</strong><br>
                            A lifelong Vineland resident and VHS graduate, Vasquez explains how years of regularly attending Board of Education meetings—and following up directly with 
                            administrators—shape her approach. She wants the district to have vocal champions while still scrutinizing process and outcomes.</p>

                            <p><strong>Platform — Educate · Empower · Equip:</strong><br>
                            <em>Educate</em>: focus on academics, age-appropriate materials, and a safe learning environment. <em>Empower</em>: ensure parents, students, and staff can speak 
                            up without fear; resolve issues internally when possible while respecting teacher voice. <em>Equip</em>: align resources and programs so students graduate 
                            truly prepared for next steps.</p>

                            <p><strong>Budget Transparency & Participation:</strong><br>
                            Vasquez argues that presentations and data should be readable, accessible, and easy to obtain at meetings (e.g., handouts and links), so engagement isn’t 
                            burdensome for families. She supports clear summaries that help the public track spending and outcomes.</p>

                            <p><strong>Graduation Readiness & Fundamentals:</strong><br>
                            Responding to concerns about readiness metrics cited by the host, Vasquez references an <em>86.3%</em> graduation rate versus a state range around 
                            <em>91–95%</em>, setting a goal of 95–100%. She emphasizes time-on-task, pacing, and tailoring curriculum to local needs so core skills land earlier and more 
                            consistently.</p>

                            <p><strong>Safety, Gangs & Building Security:</strong><br>
                            Vasquez acknowledges gang-related dynamics and supports proactive intervention, staff training, and armed security. She also wants a close look at door protocols 
                            and overall building-entry practices to reduce avoidable risks.</p>

                            <p><strong>Attendance & Truancy:</strong><br>
                            On chronic absenteeism, she favors strengthening the parent–school bridge, coordinating with social services, and recognizing complex home situations (health, 
                            single-parent households, incarceration) that impact daily attendance.</p>

                            <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
                            Vasquez frames her campaign around transparency, positivity, and practical follow-through. Whether you’re lightly engaged or deeply invested in school issues, 
                            this interview offers a clear look at how she would translate watchdog experience into board governance.</p>

                                Vasquez frames her approach around three pillars:
                                <em>Educate</em> (focus on academics, age-appropriate materials, and a safe learning environment),
                                <em>Empower</em> (parents, students, and educators are supported to speak up and participate), and
                                <em>Equip</em> (families are connected with resources that address non-academic barriers to learning).
                                She emphasizes decisions grounded in observation and data rather than trends.

                            <p>
                                Building on prior statements, Vasquez adds that readiness should be evaluated and improved through a cycle of
                                continuous assessment. She cites a current readiness rate of <strong>86.3%</strong> locally versus roughly
                                <strong>91–94.9%</strong> statewide, with a state goal of <strong>95–100%</strong>. 
                                <br>
                                Note from InformTheVoteNJ: It was presented at an August school board meeting that math readiness for graduation 
                                was at 35%, which could be perceived as a bottleneck for overall graduation readiness. We intend to follow up with 
                                Luz for the discrepancy in stats.
                                <br>
                                She wants to reinforce
                                fundamentals (especially math and reading), ensure students get sufficient time-on-task, and tailor pacing so that
                                students master core skills before moving on. She is open to more locally responsive curriculum choices when
                                statewide trends don’t fit community needs.

                                Safety remains a top priority. Vasquez supports maintaining armed guards and proactive intervention between feuding
                                groups, including staff trained to recognize gang dynamics. She plans to evaluate facility access (e.g., side and
                                rear doors) to reduce vulnerabilities while keeping front-entrance security strong.

                                Vasquez seeks a stronger parent–school bridge and timely follow-ups when attendance flags occur. She favors
                                coordination with social services when appropriate and stresses that many attendance problems have complex home
                                causes—so the district should identify issues early and connect families to help.

                                Vasquez wants educators to be free to share concerns and ideas without fear of repercussion. She encourages resolving
                                issues internally first when possible, while making sure teacher input is genuinely heard. She views staff voice as
                                essential to student outcomes.

                                Consistent with fiscal stewardship, Vasquez also wants the district’s public presentations—especially budgets—to be
                                easy to follow. That includes readable visuals and providing handouts or online materials so attendees can participate
                                meaningfully rather than straining to see tiny numbers on distant screens.

                                Vasquez identifies parental rights as a high priority. She believes parents should have primary influence in their
                                children’s education and advocates for policies that strengthen the home-to-school connection while opposing policies
                                that reduce parental involvement. She also emphasizes timely notification when challenges arise and connecting
                                families to community resources.

                                review—so residents who already show up are not made to feel like a burden for asking clarification questions.

                As a professional with a master’s degree in human services, I understand the value of education and how a good education can open 
                doors to opportunities that would otherwise not be available. I grew up not having a whole lot of money and was determined to change 
                that for my family. I understand the struggles for families and students just trying to survive. If elected, I can bring that 
                perspective to the board when committees are brainstorming ways to resolve certain issues.

                As a community member, I have been attending board of education meetings since my kids were in school, but even more since the 
                curriculum changed in 2019. As a parent, I was determined to be watchful of what was being taught and policies that were being 
                adopted. Yearly, I would make presentations to the new board congratulating them and urging them to do what is best for parents 
                and students. I have been a regular at the meetings and if elected, will continue to be involved at a much higher level. </p>

                <h4>Overall Agenda</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                There is no single item that defines my candidacy. Improving student outcomes is a complex issue with many variables. More specifically,
                I hope to work with the board and administration to improve graduation ready rates, keep everyone safe, lower absenteeism rates, and
                improve working conditions for staff—all while maintaining a budget that will not put an undue strain on local taxpayers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                It is important to have a continuous process of evaluating current practices and policies to determine how effective they are, while
                remaining flexible enough to modify based on both qualitative and quantitative data.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Working as a team with the board and administration in a collaborative way is the best approach to these complex challenges.
                </p>

                <h4>Issue Positions</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                <strong>Parental Rights</strong> is a priority for me. Parents have the primary authority and influence over their child’s upbringing. I believe
                that involving parents more deeply in educational decisions leads to better academic, behavioral, and emotional outcomes for students.
                A stronger home-to-school connection is what we need.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                I will advocate for policies that include parents in the decision-making process and will oppose policies that remove parental involvement
                from decisions concerning their child.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h4>Party Affiliation and Ideology</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                This is a non-partisan election, and I do not wish to alienate any voters because of party affiliation. However, as a person of faith, I
                approach issues from a conservative perspective and believe in viewing policy decisions through that lens.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h4>Campaign Events</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                I do not have formal campaign events scheduled, but I continue to make my rounds at local book bag drives and community block parties,
                sharing my message directly with voters in the community.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h4>Comparison</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                I can only speak for myself. For many years, I have built a reputation for advocating on behalf of children and parents—making presentations
                to the community, speaking at the State Board of Education, at legislative hearings, and at local school board meetings about issues that
                matter to me as a parent and community member. Running for the Board of Education is a natural progression of this long-standing advocacy
                and my commitment to pursuing the best outcomes for students, staff, and the local community.
