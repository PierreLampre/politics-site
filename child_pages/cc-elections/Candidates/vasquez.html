                <h6 class="page-title">Luz Vasquez</h6>
                <p>
                Luz Vasquez is running for the Vineland School Board. A lifelong Vineland resident, Vineland High School graduate, and parent,
                she frames her candidacy around improving student outcomes, supporting staff, keeping schools safe, lowering absenteeism, and
                ensuring fiscal responsibility for local taxpayers.  
                <br><br>
                Vasquez holds a master’s degree in human services and draws on her own experience growing up in a working-class family to emphasize
                opportunity and resilience. She has been a consistent attendee of school board meetings since 2019, speaking on curriculum and
                policy changes, and regularly addressing the board on behalf of parents and students.  
                <br><br>
                Her agenda highlights collaboration with the board and administration to improve her agenda. She also places a strong emphasis on 
                parental rights, pledging to advocate for policies that involve parents more directly in educational decisions.

                <p>
                Relative to the Cumberland County status quo, Vasquez’s submission is <strong>above average</strong>. She provided a structured response
                covering background, agenda, issue stances, and ideological approach—far more comprehensive than many first-time candidates.  
                <br><br>
                Her response is <em>generalized</em>, though we hope to gain clarification at our upcoming interview on WVLT (92.1 FM) on Tuesday, 
                September 9th from 5-6pm. Her stance on parental rights is somewhat clear, but other hot-button district issues (such as facilities, 
                staffing, or curriculum) are not clear with specifics.  
                <br><br>
                The transparency here signals seriousness, long-standing community involvement, and a clear conservative perspective. The follow-up 
                interview and some advertised public events would move her towards top-tier.

                <h4>Relevant Background and Experience</h4>
                <br>
                <p>As a lifelong Vineland resident, a product of the Vineland public school system and a very proud graduate of Vineland High School, 
                    I am personally invested in the mission to improve student outcomes while looking out for the best interest of local taxpayers 
                    in our community. I want to see our district succeed at every level.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                As a professional with a master’s degree in human services, I understand the value of education and how a good education can open 
                doors to opportunities that would otherwise not be available. I grew up not having a whole lot of money and was determined to change 
                that for my family. I understand the struggles for families and students just trying to survive. If elected, I can bring that 
                perspective to the board when committees are brainstorming ways to resolve certain issues. 
                </p>>
                <br>
                <p>
                As a community member, I have been attending board of education meetings since my kids were in school, but even more since the 
                curriculum changed in 2019. As a parent, I was determined to be watchful of what was being taught and policies that were being 
                adopted. Yearly, I would make presentations to the new board congratulating them and urging them to do what is best for parents 
                and students. I have been a regular at the meetings and if elected, will continue to be involved at a much higher level. </p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Overall Agenda</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                There is no single item that defines my candidacy. Improving student outcomes is a complex issue with many variables. More specifically,
                I hope to work with the board and administration to improve graduation ready rates, keep everyone safe, lower absenteeism rates, and
                improve working conditions for staff—all while maintaining a budget that will not put an undue strain on local taxpayers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                It is important to have a continuous process of evaluating current practices and policies to determine how effective they are, while
                remaining flexible enough to modify based on both qualitative and quantitative data.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Working as a team with the board and administration in a collaborative way is the best approach to these complex challenges.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h4>Issue Positions</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                <strong>Parental Rights</strong> is a priority for me. Parents have the primary authority and influence over their child’s upbringing. I believe
                that involving parents more deeply in educational decisions leads to better academic, behavioral, and emotional outcomes for students.
                A stronger home-to-school connection is what we need.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                I will advocate for policies that include parents in the decision-making process and will oppose policies that remove parental involvement
                from decisions concerning their child.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h4>Party Affiliation and Ideology</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                This is a non-partisan election, and I do not wish to alienate any voters because of party affiliation. However, as a person of faith, I
                approach issues from a conservative perspective and believe in viewing policy decisions through that lens.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h4>Campaign Events</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                I do not have formal campaign events scheduled, but I continue to make my rounds at local book bag drives and community block parties,
                sharing my message directly with voters in the community.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h4>Comparison</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                I can only speak for myself. For many years, I have built a reputation for advocating on behalf of children and parents—making presentations
                to the community, speaking at the State Board of Education, at legislative hearings, and at local school board meetings about issues that
                matter to me as a parent and community member. Running for the Board of Education is a natural progression of this long-standing advocacy
                and my commitment to pursuing the best outcomes for students, staff, and the local community.
