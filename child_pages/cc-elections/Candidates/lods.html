              <p>          

                Victoria Groetsch-Lods is a first-term Cumberland County Commissioner with a multifaceted background in communications, agriculture, education, 
                and public service. She’s worked as a high school teacher, chief of staff in the State Senate, and served as the first executive director of 
                Cumberland County Habitat for Humanity. Her public messaging emphasizes a commitment to education, agriculture, mental health and addiction 
                services, and community resilience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lods is frequently seen at community events and regularly attends Republican gatherings, including the bi-weekly party breakfasts—though those 
                events have recently shifted in nature, limiting public access. Still, she maintains a steady public presence and has become increasingly 
                active on Facebook, using the platform to share her work and highlight specific priorities.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, her campaign has yet to present a fully structured platform outlining her policy goals or current stances in one place. While her 
                messaging has grown more specific over time, much of it remains spread across individual posts and public appearances, making it harder for 
                voters to assess her full agenda at a glance.

              <p>          

                Across the county, some local campaigns continue to fall short when it comes to transparency—offering little more than scattered social media 
                posts, vague slogans, or interviews that veer off into dinner specials or decades-old political nostalgia. For voters trying to make 
                informed decisions, this patchwork approach often becomes a barrier to engagement.
                <br>
                <br>
                In that context, Commissioner Victoria Groetsch-Lods stands out for providing a clearly structured and relevant interview that breaks from the 
                usual pattern. Rather than mixing in unrelated content or burying useful details, her recent interview offers two distinct halves: one focused 
                on her background and experience, and the other on specific county-level issues and her forward-looking agenda. This format not only builds 
                trust in the content itself, but makes it easier for voters to jump to the parts that matter most to their personal decision-making.
                <br>
                <br>
                The interview now lives on this information hub as a reference point for the public—a strong step in the right direction. While this doesn't 
                yet represent full-spectrum transparency, it sets a higher bar than many other candidates and offers a credible foundation to build on.
                <br>
                <br>
                If future updates continue to follow this model—addressing more issues, making comparisons clearer, and responding to developments as campaign 
                season unfolds—Lods could help reframe what transparency looks like for down-ballot races. The door is open for voters to stay informed, and 
                for the candidate to continue rising above the status quo.

            <p>In this 60-minute interview, Cumberland County Commissioner Victoria Lods sits down with former Freeholder Jim Quinn at the Queen 
                Diner in Millville. The first 30 minutes could be seen as a somewhat informal 'meet the candidate' section as they discuss her personal and 
                professional background, where the second half shifts to focus on a couple of major county-level issues and a long-term development goal.</p>

            <p><strong>County Jail Reform and Regional Collaboration:</strong><br>
            Lods offers a detailed update on the long-delayed county jail project. While a 2019 plan to build a new jail was shelved, 
            the county is now exploring a joint facility with Camden County—possibly including Gloucester and Salem as well. In the interim, Camden will 
            house Cumberland inmates, replacing the costly and inefficient use of Hudson County facilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Broadband Expansion and Fiscal Responsibility:</strong><br>
            Lods explains the trajectory of the federally funded Middle Mile broadband initiative. Originally led by Cumberland County, the project has 
            experienced complications and unexpected costs. A pending vote may shift leadership of the grant to Salem County, allowing the project to move 
            forward without additional taxpayer burden while still serving Cumberland residents.</p>

            <p><strong>Economic Development through Bayshore Promotion:</strong><br>
            In her broader agenda, Lods emphasizes marketing the Bayshore area—kayaking, bird trails, scenic byways, and local dining—as a tourism and 
            quality-of-life attraction. Part of the goal is to entice outside businesses and residents by building a lifestyle-friendly brand for Cumberland County, 
            boosting long-term economic prospects.</p>

            <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
            Throughout the interview, Lods presents herself as a pragmatic coalition-builder who values cross-county collaboration, infrastructure 
            modernization, and community vitality. Whether you're a casual viewer or closely tracking county affairs, this conversation offers a direct 
            look at her leadership style and priorities ahead of the 2025 election.</p>

                        students. She noted that many programs already exist to combat these crises and supports expanding awareness and access to them. Her recent attendance 
                        at the Maryville Recovery for Life Gala highlights her commitment to supporting recovery programs and recognizing leaders like Senator Michael Testa, 
                        who are working to improve access to treatment.

                        Community Engagement: Lods encourages more civic participation, especially among youth. She believes that community members should be involved in 
                        political discussions and campaigns and that public servants should remain visible and connected to the residents they serve.

                        County Jail Project: In a recent interview with Jim Quinn, Lods explained that the original plan to build a new jail in 2019 was 
                        abandoned. Inmates are currently housed in Hudson County at high expense. Cumberland is now pursuing a regional jail model with Camden, 
                        with possible participation from Gloucester and Salem. Camden will house inmates in the short term, reducing transport costs. We assume 
                        at this point this is her general position on how to handle the issue.
