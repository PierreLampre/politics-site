              <p>          

                Victoria Groetsch-Lods is a first-term Cumberland County Commissioner with a background spanning communications, education, agriculture, and 
                nonprofit leadership. She has served as a high school teacher, chief of staff in the State Senate, and the first executive director of 
                Cumberland County Habitat for Humanity. Active on her family’s fifth-generation farm, she brings a direct perspective on the challenges 
                facing agriculture and frequently emphasizes the importance of meeting people “where they are” to ensure programs and resources are accessible.
                <br>
                <br>
                Her current agenda highlights agriculture advocacy (connecting farmers with state programs and Rutgers partnerships), education and workforce 
                development (expanding CCTECH seats and trade pathways), addiction and recovery awareness (with a focus on parent outreach), and 
                responsible growth projects like the Nabb Avenue extension. She also stresses that recreation, open space, and health are essential to 
                making Cumberland more attractive for employers and families.
                <br>
                <br>
                Recent updates from her tenure include maintaining stable county taxes for two years and lowering the tax rate by two cents in 2025, 
                spearheading a seminar to assist veterans in navigating benefits, and supporting the launch of NJ Transit’s new Vineland Commuter Express 
                to connect residents with job opportunities in Atlantic City.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lods is a consistent presence at civic events and county functions and has been more accessible than many peers in engaging with local press 
                and interviews. She has increasingly outlined concrete initiatives and accomplishments, offering voters a clearer picture of her priorities when
                compared to many other candidates throughout the county.

              <h6 class="page-title">Victoria Lods</h6>
              <p>          
                Across Cumberland County, candidate communication often remains inconsistent—some relying on scattered social media posts, others sticking 
                to broad slogans, and many avoiding direct press engagement altogether. In that environment, the burden on voters to piece together 
                meaningful information is unreasonably high, and the lack of standardized, centralized campaign expectations only reinforces the gap.
                <br>
                <br>
                Against this backdrop, Commissioner Victoria Groetsch-Lods has shown clear progress this election season. She has not only participated in 
                a structured, in-depth interview that separated her background from her agenda, but also provided detailed responses on agriculture, 
                education, addiction, and infrastructure in ways that break from the county’s usual “surface-level” trend. These efforts make her more 
                accessible and transparent than many peers and demonstrate what is possible when candidates engage with voters through substantive formats.
                <br>
                <br>
                Her trajectory continues to trend upward as she remains consistently present at public events and open to dialogue with local press. 
                While full-spectrum transparency would benefit from a countywide system that centralizes and standardizes campaign information, Lods has 
                built a credible foundation that sets her apart within the current status quo. If other candidates followed suit—or if the county established 
                clearer expectations for all—voters would have a much easier time making informed decisions. For now, her approach signals a constructive step 
                forward, both for her own campaign and for what transparency could look like across Cumberland County.

        <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
            <p>In this 60-minute interview, Cumberland County Commissioner Victoria Lods sits down with former Freeholder Jim Quinn at the Queen 
                Diner in Millville. The first 30 minutes could be seen as a somewhat informal 'meet the candidate' section as they discuss her personal and 
                professional background, where the second half shifts to focus on a couple of major county-level issues and a long-term development goal.</p>

            <p><strong>County Jail Reform and Regional Collaboration:</strong><br>
            Lods offers a detailed update on the long-delayed county jail project. While a 2019 plan to build a new jail was shelved, 
            the county is now exploring a joint facility with Camden County—possibly including Gloucester and Salem as well. In the interim, Camden will 
            house Cumberland inmates, replacing the costly and inefficient use of Hudson County facilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Broadband Expansion and Fiscal Responsibility:</strong><br>
            Lods explains the trajectory of the federally funded Middle Mile broadband initiative. Originally led by Cumberland County, the project has 
            experienced complications and unexpected costs. A pending vote may shift leadership of the grant to Salem County, allowing the project to move 
            forward without additional taxpayer burden while still serving Cumberland residents.</p>

            <p><strong>Economic Development through Bayshore Promotion:</strong><br>
            In her broader agenda, Lods emphasizes marketing the Bayshore area—kayaking, bird trails, scenic byways, and local dining—as a tourism and 
            quality-of-life attraction. Part of the goal is to entice outside businesses and residents by building a lifestyle-friendly brand for Cumberland County, 
            boosting long-term economic prospects.</p>

            <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
            Throughout the interview, Lods presents herself as a pragmatic coalition-builder who values cross-county collaboration, infrastructure 
            modernization, and community vitality. Whether you're a casual viewer or closely tracking county affairs, this conversation offers a direct 
            look at her leadership style and priorities ahead of the 2025 election.</p>

                    In this interview, Cumberland County Commissioner <strong>Victoria Lods</strong> (incumbent, up for re-election) 
                    discusses the demands of public service, the importance of transparency and communication, and her 
                    focus areas of <strong>agriculture, education, and addiction recovery</strong>. She frames her role as 
                    empowering residents’ voices rather than pursuing a personal agenda, stressing the high bar of time and 
                    energy required for effective representation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lods reflects on her journalism background, the decline of local press, and why communication is essential 
                    for good governance. She draws from her <strong>fifth-generation farming heritage</strong> to explain why agriculture 
                    needs stronger advocacy and incentives. On education, she highlights adapting to technology, supporting 
                    vocational pathways, and growing recreation as part of economic development. She also speaks about 
                    <strong>addiction as a global crisis</strong>, youth attitudes toward drugs, and the need for stronger parent 
                    awareness. Finally, she endorses the <strong>Nabb Avenue extension</strong> as a critical infrastructure project, 
                    emphasizing the need for multi-level funding cooperation.

                <p>
                Drawing on her fifth-generation farming background, Lods aims to stabilize and grow local agriculture by:
                <em>(1)</em> acting as a county-level <strong>conduit</strong> between farmers and Trenton (alerts, grants, and program access);
                <em>(2)</em> strengthening <strong>Rutgers/Extension partnerships</strong> (e.g., on-site packaging/processing options and crop modernization);
                <em>(3)</em> practicing true “meeting people where they are” outreach (avoid 9 a.m. visits mid-harvest; bring info to auctions/meetups);
                <em>(4)</em> advocating for <strong>incentives</strong> that address the cost–price squeeze driving family farms out of business.

                <p>
                As a high school teacher and commissioner liaison, Lods emphasizes adapting instruction to today’s tech realities,
                expanding <strong>CCTECH</strong> seats (Cumberland County Technical Education Center), and aligning districts with <strong>RCSJ</strong> and union apprenticeships.
                Priority: build a <strong>skilled workforce pipeline</strong> so employers see Cumberland County as a place to hire and stay.

                To attract businesses and retain families, Lods supports rapidly standing up a <strong>county recreation function</strong> (a gap she identified),
                linking open space, health, and recreation to talent attraction and long-term economic development.

                <p>
                Treat addiction as a countywide health priority: promote <strong>overdose spike alerts</strong>, expand outreach at
                <strong>back-to-school</strong> events, and equip parents with practical knowledge (vapes, edibles, hidden paraphernalia).
                Notes a generational shift—<em>youth are increasingly cautious</em> after witnessing harms in their communities.

                <p>
                With a journalism/PR background, Lods underscores that robust <strong>communication</strong> is core to governing.
                She supports rebuilding public-facing information flows (press, forums, liaison reports) and expects candidates/officials to
                <strong>engage substantively</strong> with voters and local media.

                Input costs rise while farmgate prices lag. Lods argues for targeted <strong>state and federal incentives</strong>, plus
                <strong>value-add</strong> options (pack/freezing, crop shifts) to improve margins, and county-facilitated access to programs.
