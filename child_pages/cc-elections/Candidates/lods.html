              <h6 class="page-title">Victoria Lods</h6>
              <p>
                Commissioner Lods is running as a challenger against Celeste Riley for the County Clerk seat. She has been involved in politics for decades, having previously held positions 
                such as Chief of Staff for a State Senator and she was the Executive Director for Habitat for Humanity. She is currently a County Commissioner. At a recent Republican breakfast 
                meeting, Lods pointed out several things that could be seen as why she is running for the position and how she differentiates herself from the incumbent:
                <br>
                1. Competence for the role of County Clerk is important because they are responsible for elections and could make election related errors.
                <br>
                2. It is important for the Clerk to actually show up for work on a regular basis and not focus on peripheral tasks such as ribbon cuttings.
                <br>
                3. It is common for administrative politicians to make excuses for why things aren't getting done, like broken printers in the office.
                <br>                
                When asked in person about what the specific role is of the County Clerk and how she would differentiate herself from the incumbent, she responded "If you don't
                know what the County Clerk does, that should tell you enough about how the role is being executed.", which I believe implies that the County Clerk should be 
                acting as the known liason between the public and the government, which is a common perception of the role. Click the x at the top red of this box to go back to the page.

        <h4 class="sub-heading">party messaging</h4>
        <div class="agenda-thesis">
            After reaching out to multiple members of the CCRRO, it is not totally clear how the Republican party platform applies to Cumberland County. However, one could infer 
            some of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Opposition to policy 5756 in the school system (the notorious 'Trans rights vs Parents rights' issue) suggests pushing for socially conservative values.
                    <a href="https://thelocallens.org/vineland-school-board-votes-to-repeal-transgender-student-rights-policy-amid-community-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="website-link">Local Lens Article</a>
                </li>
                <li>Opposition to projects like a 50+ million dollar French Museum in Jersey City suggests prioritization on fiscal conservatism. 
                    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/arts/design/new-jersey-centre-pompidou-museum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="website-link">New York Times Article</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>      

        <h4 class="sub-heading">policy positions</h4>
        <div class="policy-positions">
            After reaching out to Commissioner Lods and receiving no response, it is unclear how any policy positions she may have relates to the office of County Clerk other than she 
            might be more cooperative with the overall Republican party dominance at the county level and therefore might help them complete tasks more efficiently.
