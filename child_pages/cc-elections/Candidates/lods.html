              <p>          

                Victoria Groetsch-Lods is a first-term Cumberland County Commissioner with a multifaceted background in communications, agriculture, education, and public service. She’s worked as a high school teacher, 
                chief of staff in the State Senate, and served as the first executive director of Cumberland County Habitat for Humanity. Her public messaging emphasizes a commitment to education, agriculture, mental 
                health and addiction services, and community resilience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lods is frequently seen at community events and regularly attends Republican gatherings, including the bi-weekly party breakfasts—though those events have recently shifted in nature, limiting public 
                access. Still, she maintains a steady public presence and has become increasingly active on Facebook, using the platform to share her work and highlight specific priorities.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, her campaign has yet to present a fully structured platform outlining her policy goals or current stances in one place. While her messaging has grown more specific over time, much of it 
                remains spread across individual posts and public appearances, making it harder for voters to assess her full agenda at a glance.

              <h6 class="page-title">Victoria Lods</h6>
              <p>          

                Victoria Groetsch-Lods is visible in the community, regularly attends party events, and maintains a consistent online presence—but her transparency as a candidate remains average due to a lack of 
                a fully comprehensive campaign site with stances on well known, ongoing issues. While she often speaks about welcoming press engagement and holds a degree in journalism, she has not responded to multiple 
                outreach attempts for interviews or questionnaires—even after asking in person whether she's been receving our emails.
                <br>
                <br>
                Adding to the confusion is the recent shift in accessibility of the bi-weekly Republican breakfasts. Once open to the press and other political affiliations, these events are now restricted to 
                Republicans only, following public criticism of a primary race’s lack of visibility. This change not only limits the flow of public information but creates new uncertainty about what details from 
                candidate speeches—such as those given by Lods—can be responsibly shared. For a voter relying on facts rather than impressions, this leaves significant blind spots.
                <br>
                <br>
                To her credit, Lods has clearly been doing the work and staying engaged in local government. But here’s where the gap lies: social media posts and brief mentions in party newsletters are no substitute for 
                a comprehensive campaign platform. Voters can’t be expected to piece together scattered updates from Facebook or recall remarks made four months ago at a breakfast meeting. As someone deeply 
                involved in local transparency efforts, I believe voters deserve access to something centralized—an information packet or candidate hub that clearly outlines where a candidate stands on core county issues 
                like the Middle Mile Broadband project, the Nabb Avenue Extension, county fiscal priorities, public health, and economic development.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s also worth noting that Lods may be operating within constraints beyond her control. As part of an organized party ticket, campaign strategy may play a role in limiting individual engagement—even 
                when a candidate may personally be more open. While that’s speculative, it’s a reasonable consideration given the dynamics at play in other local campaigns.
                <br>
                <br>
                In short: Lods appears capable, connected, and experienced—but until her campaign provides structured, accessible documentation of her plans and policy positions, her transparency rating remains 
                “average”. The good news? With a few intentional steps—such as a candidate Q&A, issue page, or podcast-style interview—she could easily set herself apart as both qualified and accountable.

                <ul>
                    <li>Education Advocacy: Continues to champion the role of schools and educators, both as a teacher and policymaker, supporting local students and 
                        promoting state-level funding for county districts.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Agricultural Representation: As a lifelong farmer, Lods brings direct knowledge of agricultural challenges and pushes for supportive local policies 
                        and economic opportunity in the farming sector.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Mental Health & Addiction Services: Vocal about expanding access to these services, though specific initiatives are not currently well-publicized 
                        online.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h4 class="sub-heading">Issues</h4>
            <div class="experience can-sec">
                <ul>
                    <li>Mental Health & Addiction Services: Lods has been vocal about the importance of addressing mental health and addiction issues, particularly among 
                        students. She noted that many programs already exist to combat these crises and supports expanding awareness and access to them. Her recent attendance 
                        at the Maryville Recovery for Life Gala highlights her commitment to supporting recovery programs and recognizing leaders like Senator Michael Testa, 
                        who are working to improve access to treatment.
                    </li>

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Community Engagement: Lods encourages more civic participation, especially among youth. She believes that community members should be involved in 
                        political discussions and campaigns and that public servants should remain visible and connected to the residents they serve.
