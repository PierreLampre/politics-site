              <h6 class="page-title">Victoria Lods</h6>
              <p>
                Commissioner Lods is running as a challenger against Celeste Riley for the County Clerk seat. She has been involved in politics for decades, having previously held positions 
                such as Chief of Staff for a State Senator and she was the Executive Director for Habitat for Humanity. She is currently a County Commissioner. At a recent Republican breakfast 
                meeting, Lods pointed out several things that could be seen as why she is running for the position and how she differentiates herself from the incumbent:
                <br>
                1. Competence for the role of County Clerk is important because they are responsible for elections and could make election related errors. The following might be an 
                example of this: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/781111154116727/?multi_permalinks=850813927146449&ref=share">NJ Globe Article</a>
                <br>
                2. It is important for the Clerk to actually show up for work on a regular basis and not focus on peripheral tasks such as ribbon cuttings.
                <br>
                3. It is common for administrative politicians to make excuses for why things aren't getting done, like broken printers in the office.
                <br>       
                4. Appropriate execution of job duties is important. For example, the current clerk has recused herself from election duties, but has her 
                picture on election information mailers. So two questions arise: 1. How can she recuse herself from one of her most important duties? 
                2. Why would her picture appear on mailers that are meant to present neutral voting information (election date, how to vote early, etc.)?

                When asked in person about what the specific role is of the County Clerk and how she would differentiate herself from the incumbent, she responded "If you don't
                know what the County Clerk does, that should tell you enough about how the role is being executed.", which I believe implies that the County Clerk should be 
                acting as the known liason between the public and the government. She also released the following video to help clarify the 
                role of the clerk:

            To be clear, with the lack of a proper newspaper providing thorough, professional-level election coverage, both sides of the aisle in *local* 
            politics seem to be suffering from a lack of clear messaging. This is not to say that they aren't putting forward a lot of effort to message, 
            but the information is oftentimes scattered across the internet, spoken about at meetings/events that appear partisan or have expensive 
            sponsorship fees, or mentioned at lengthy meetings most people simply won't attend. Oftentimes people get brief literature like

            . They also might get vague impressions of what local Republicans or Democrats might believe based on what they know about national politics.
            While we have been able to gather some specific information about Lods run for County Clerk, as shown by the above agenda and our references 
            to the issues surrounding the ballot design and election mailers from the clerk's office, there is probably a lot more detail that we could go 
            into about the specifics of the clerk's office and Lods campaign bid.
            <br>
            <br>
            The one general point that the party has made clear regarding the local level, is that the Democrat party has been predominantly in control for 
            the past 40 odd years, and they have made a mess while doing so, so perhaps it is time to let the Republicans take control for a while so they 
            can clean it up.

        <div class="policy-positions can-sec">
            After reaching out to Commissioner Lods and receiving no response, it is unclear how any policy positions she may have relates to the office of 
            County Clerk other than she might be more cooperative with the overall Republican party at the county level and therefore might help 
            them complete tasks more efficiently.

            However, there have been some clear issues regarding the clerk's office's handling of the general election ballot design and election information 
            material coming from the clerk's office... and Lods has made it clear that she will ensure election integrity moving forward if elected.

              <p>          

                Victoria Groetsch-Lods is a first-term Cumberland County Commissioner with a wide-ranging background in communications, education, agriculture, and government. She’s worked 
                as a high school educator, former chief of staff in the State Senate, and the first executive director of Cumberland County Habitat for Humanity. She also comes from a 
                multi-generational farming family and has been active in local boards and public service throughout her career.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since taking office, she has focused on issues like education, agriculture, mental health, and addiction services.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lods is visible in the community and regularly attends local Republican events where she is approachable and willing to engage. However, her campaign lacks a 
                centralized platform or clear public documentation of her current stances, making it difficult for voters to get a comprehensive view of her priorities without attending 
                in-person events.
                <br>
                <br>
                Given her communications background, there’s an opportunity for her to help set a new standard for public-facing engagement—but that shift has yet to fully take shape.

              <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
              <h6 class="page-title">Victoria Lods</h6>
              <p>          

                Victoria Lods is currently serving her first term on the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners. With a professional background that spans communications, education, state 
                government, and agriculture, she brings a diverse and practical skill set to the board. Her previous roles include serving as chief of staff to a state senator, executive 
                director of Cumberland County Habitat for Humanity, and a teacher at both Bridgeton and Millville High Schools. She’s also a fifth-generation resident of her family’s 
                South Jersey farm, deeply rooted in the community she serves.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lods has maintained a visible presence during her time in office, regularly attending Republican bi-weekly breakfast events and staying engaged with local constituents. 
                When approached, she is friendly, articulate, and more than willing to converse—traits that make her approachable in person.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, like most local candidates in this cycle, her public campaign infrastructure hasn’t caught up with what voters now expect in 2025. There’s currently no campaign 
                website specifically for her, no comprehensive platform summary, and no participation in centralized efforts to provide side-by-side comparisons or deeper policy discussions.
                <br>
                <br>
                And that’s the real disconnect—not just with Lods, but across the board: while face-to-face conversations and live events are valuable, they no longer satisfy the modern 
                expectation of accessible, on-demand information. In a digital era where voters ought to be able track infrastructure projects like the Middle Mile Broadband initiative 
                somewhat regularly, they’re also looking for candidates who proactively address those same issues with clear, documented perspectives... without necessarily reviewing 
                every county, city, school board, and state meeting.
                <br>
                <br>
                This becomes even more noticeable in Lods’ case, given her academic background in Communications and Journalism—fields built around the importance of message clarity and 
                audience reach. One might expect someone with that training to do more to help bridge the gap between traditional campaigning and 21st-century civic transparency. Yet, we 
                still lack a centralized reference point for her current priorities, stances, or comparisons to her opponents.
                <br>
                <br>
                To be fair, she is far more present than candidates who remain completely out of view—but without more centrally accessible, digital campaign messaging, even an engaged 
                candidate can feel distant to the average voter.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, the opportunity to improve remains fully open. A completed questionnaire, a podcast interview, and a detailed list of policy positions on key county issues 
                would go a long way toward increasing her transparency score.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, Victoria Groetsch-Lods currently receives an almost above average rating for transparency and accessibility.

                <ul>
                    <li>Education Advocacy: Continues to champion the role of schools and educators, both as a teacher and policymaker, supporting local students and 
                        promoting state-level funding for county districts.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Agricultural Representation: As a lifelong farmer, Lods brings direct knowledge of agricultural challenges and pushes for supportive local policies 
                        and economic opportunity in the farming sector.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Mental Health & Addiction Services: Vocal about expanding access to these services, though specific initiatives are not currently well-publicized 
                        online.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="experience can-sec">
                <ul>
                    <li>Mental Health & Addiction Services: Lods has been vocal about the importance of addressing mental health and addiction issues, particularly among 
                        students. She noted that many programs already exist to combat these crises and supports expanding awareness and access to them. Her recent attendance 
                        at the Maryville Recovery for Life Gala highlights her commitment to supporting recovery programs and recognizing leaders like Senator Michael Testa, 
                        who are working to improve access to treatment.
                    </li>

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Community Engagement: Lods encourages more civic participation, especially among youth. She believes that community members should be involved in 
                        political discussions and campaigns and that public servants should remain visible and connected to the residents they serve.
