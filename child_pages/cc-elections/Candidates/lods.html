              <h6 class="page-title">Victoria Lods</h6>
              <p>
                Commissioner Lods is running as a challenger against Celeste Riley for the County Clerk seat. She has been involved in politics for decades, having previously held positions 
                such as Chief of Staff for a State Senator and she was the Executive Director for Habitat for Humanity. She is currently a County Commissioner. At a recent Republican breakfast 
                meeting, Lods pointed out several things that could be seen as why she is running for the position and how she differentiates herself from the incumbent:
                <br>
                1. Competence for the role of County Clerk is important because they are responsible for elections and could make election related errors. The following might be an 
                example of this: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/781111154116727/?multi_permalinks=850813927146449&ref=share">NJ Globe Article</a>
                <br>
                2. It is important for the Clerk to actually show up for work on a regular basis and not focus on peripheral tasks such as ribbon cuttings.
                <br>
                3. It is common for administrative politicians to make excuses for why things aren't getting done, like broken printers in the office.
                <br>       
                4. Appropriate execution of job duties is important. For example, the current clerk has recused herself from election duties, but has her 
                picture on election information mailers. So two questions arise: 1. How can she recuse herself from one of her most important duties? 
                2. Why would her picture appear on mailers that are meant to present neutral voting information (election date, how to vote early, etc.)?

                When asked in person about what the specific role is of the County Clerk and how she would differentiate herself from the incumbent, she responded "If you don't
                know what the County Clerk does, that should tell you enough about how the role is being executed.", which I believe implies that the County Clerk should be 
                acting as the known liason between the public and the government. She also released the following video to help clarify the 
                role of the clerk:

            To be clear, with the lack of a proper newspaper providing thorough, professional-level election coverage, both sides of the aisle in *local* 
            politics seem to be suffering from a lack of clear messaging. This is not to say that they aren't putting forward a lot of effort to message, 
            but the information is oftentimes scattered across the internet, spoken about at meetings/events that appear partisan or have expensive 
            sponsorship fees, or mentioned at lengthy meetings most people simply won't attend. Oftentimes people get brief literature like

            . They also might get vague impressions of what local Republicans or Democrats might believe based on what they know about national politics.
            While we have been able to gather some specific information about Lods run for County Clerk, as shown by the above agenda and our references 
            to the issues surrounding the ballot design and election mailers from the clerk's office, there is probably a lot more detail that we could go 
            into about the specifics of the clerk's office and Lods campaign bid.
            <br>
            <br>
            The one general point that the party has made clear regarding the local level, is that the Democrat party has been predominantly in control for 
            the past 40 odd years, and they have made a mess while doing so, so perhaps it is time to let the Republicans take control for a while so they 
            can clean it up.

        <h4 class="sub-heading">policy positions and issues</h4>
        <div class="policy-positions can-sec">
            After reaching out to Commissioner Lods and receiving no response, it is unclear how any policy positions she may have relates to the office of 
            County Clerk other than she might be more cooperative with the overall Republican party at the county level and therefore might help 
            them complete tasks more efficiently.

            However, there have been some clear issues regarding the clerk's office's handling of the general election ballot design and election information 
            material coming from the clerk's office... and Lods has made it clear that she will ensure election integrity moving forward if elected.

              <p>          

                Victoria Groetsch-Lods is currently seeking a second term as a Cumberland County Commissioner. A lifelong resident of Vineland and a member of a fifth-generation family 
                farm, Lods brings a deep connection to the county along with a wide range of public service experience. Her career includes work in state government, 
                non-profit leadership, and public education—giving her insight into issues like agriculture, education, economic development, and social services.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before her time on the Board of Commissioners, she served as Chief of Staff to State Senator Nicholas Asselta, helping to shape legislation related to school 
                funding and economic growth in South Jersey. She later became the first Executive Director of Cumberland County Habitat for Humanity, where she led housing 
                efforts for families in need. Today, she teaches at Millville High School, continuing her long-standing commitment to youth and education.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a Commissioner, Lods has focused on education, agriculture, mental health, and addiction services. Her advocacy is grounded in practical knowledge and 
                hands-on experience. Whether serving many previously elected positions, holding several behind the scenes positions, and running various races, Lods 
                has consistently positioned herself as a voice for everyday residents and a supporter of responsible, transparent government.

                    <li>Education Advocacy: Continues to champion the role of schools and educators, both as a teacher and policymaker, supporting local students and 
                        promoting state-level funding for county districts.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Agricultural Representation: As a lifelong farmer, Lods brings direct knowledge of agricultural challenges and pushes for supportive local policies

                    <li>Mental Health & Addiction Services: Vocal about expanding access to these services, though specific initiatives are not currently well-publicized 
                        online.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mental Health & Addiction Services: Lods has been vocal about the importance of addressing mental health and addiction issues, particularly among 
                        students. She noted that many programs already exist to combat these crises and supports expanding awareness and access to them. Her recent attendance 
                        at the Maryville Recovery for Life Gala highlights her commitment to supporting recovery programs and recognizing leaders like Senator Michael Testa, 
                        who are working to improve access to treatment.

                    <li>
                        Community Engagement: Lods encourages more civic participation, especially among youth. She believes that community members should be involved in 
                        political discussions and campaigns and that public servants should remain visible and connected to the residents they serve.
