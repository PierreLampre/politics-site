              <p>          

                Victoria Groetsch-Lods is a first-term Cumberland County Commissioner with a wide-ranging background in communications, education, agriculture, and government. She’s worked 
                as a high school educator, former chief of staff in the State Senate, and the first executive director of Cumberland County Habitat for Humanity. She also comes from a 
                multi-generational farming family and has been active in local boards and public service throughout her career.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since taking office, she has focused on issues like education, agriculture, mental health, and addiction services.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lods is visible in the community and regularly attends local Republican events where she is approachable and willing to engage. However, her campaign lacks a 
                centralized platform or clear public documentation of her current stances, making it difficult for voters to get a comprehensive view of her priorities without attending 
                in-person events.
                <br>
                <br>
                Given her communications background, there’s an opportunity for her to help set a new standard for public-facing engagement—but that shift has yet to fully take shape.

              <h6 class="page-title">Victoria Lods</h6>
              <p>          

                Victoria Groetsch-Lods is currently serving her first term on the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners and is seeking reelection. Her public bio highlights her deep 
                community ties, a strong resume in public service, and a general focus on important issues like education, agriculture, and services for mental health and addiction. She also 
                brings experience from prior legislative roles, having served as chief-of-staff in the state senate and as the first executive director of Cumberland County Habitat for 
                Humanity.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, while her bio clearly shows that she is engaged and has a strong understanding of county operations, the messaging stops short of laying out a full, voter-friendly 
                platform and action plan.
                <br>
                <br>
                She briefly states that she has championed issues like education and agriculture, but it’s unclear what progress has been made so far or what she plans to do next. For 
                example:

                <ul>
                    <li>She mentions having helped maximize school funding in the past, but what is her plan to secure or improve funding moving forward?</li>

                    <li>She notes that she has a “keen understanding” of how government layers work together to get things done—but what does that mean for voters today? Is she applying 
                        that knowledge to current county challenges like broadband, housing, public health, or economic development?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <br>
                She also references her role in stimulating economic development during her previous tenure in Trenton, which is certainly relevant—but again, there’s no detailed explanation 
                of what that experience has translated into during her time as commissioner, or what she hopes to do next.

                <br>
                <br>
                In short, Lods appears to be fully capable and already doing the work, which would make it all the more effective if she spelled out her ongoing priorities and how her skill 
                set sets her apart from her challengers. Compared to her likely general election opponents:

                <ul>
                    <li>Capizola doesn’t even mention current issues in his public bio.</li>

                    <li>Balicki references support for the arts, but not much more in terms of local policy.
                    </li>

                    <li>Smith has clearly laid out a full platform and sat down for an interview with us to clarify her platform.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <br>

                If Lods clearly documented her vision in a centralized campaign website—complete with issue breakdowns, podcast-style interviews, and participation in events like candidate 
                forums—she would make a very strong case for why she is not only already doing the job, but the obvious choice to continue doing it as well.

                <br>
                <br>

                For now, she receives an “average” transparency rating—based on visible public presence and clear experience—but with a very reachable path to move into full transparency with 
                just a bit more intention and structure.

                    <li>Education Advocacy: Continues to champion the role of schools and educators, both as a teacher and policymaker, supporting local students and 
                        promoting state-level funding for county districts.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>Agricultural Representation: As a lifelong farmer, Lods brings direct knowledge of agricultural challenges and pushes for supportive local policies 
                        and economic opportunity in the farming sector.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>Mental Health & Addiction Services: Vocal about expanding access to these services, though specific initiatives are not currently well-publicized 
                        online.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mental Health & Addiction Services: Lods has been vocal about the importance of addressing mental health and addiction issues, particularly among 
                        students. She noted that many programs already exist to combat these crises and supports expanding awareness and access to them. Her recent attendance 
                        at the Maryville Recovery for Life Gala highlights her commitment to supporting recovery programs and recognizing leaders like Senator Michael Testa, 
                        who are working to improve access to treatment.

                    <li>
                        Community Engagement: Lods encourages more civic participation, especially among youth. She believes that community members should be involved in 
                        political discussions and campaigns and that public servants should remain visible and connected to the residents they serve.
