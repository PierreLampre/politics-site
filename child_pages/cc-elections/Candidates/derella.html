              <h6 class="page-title">Joseph Derella</h6>
              <p>          

                Joe Derella, a lifelong Millville resident and 1978 graduate of West Chester University with a degree in Health and Physical Education, 
                built his early career teaching and coaching at Millville High School before spending more than three decades managing sixteen outpatient 
                and physical-therapy facilities for NovaCare and later overseeing 500-plus employees in emergency services and occupational health at 
                Inspira. He retired in 2024 after forty-two years in healthcare and nearly three decades in public service—four years on the school board 
                (one as president), fifteen as city commissioner (eight as vice mayor and finance director), and nine as county commissioner and director 
                of administration and public safety. At the county level he served as president of the South Jersey Commissioners Association and vice 
                president of the New Jersey Association of Counties, building a network that continues to inform his pragmatic, team-based approach to 
                local governance.
                <br>
                <br>
                Derella’s record includes hands-on contributions to Millville’s transformation during the 2000s and 2010s — projects such as the Culver 
                Center, Levoy Theatre restoration, Buck Park, Union Lake Crossing, and New Jersey Motorsports Park — as well as county initiatives like the 
                CC Tech School expansion, Rowan College of South Jersey partnership, Veterans Cemetery Pavilion, 911 communications upgrade, and a Positive 
                Youth Coalition that cut juvenile crime by 40 percent. He points to bipartisan budget committees and long-standing cooperation with Republican 
                colleagues as proof that attitude and communication matter more than party lines. Now retired, he frames his campaign as a chance to mentor 
                younger officials and apply that experience to help “make Millville a little bit better.”
                <br>
                <br>
                His agenda centers on process, safety, and coordinated growth. He proposes a “fix-small-things-first” revitalization of the Arts District — 
                lighting from Buck to Sixth, clean streets, and visible police during Third Fridays — backed by a monthly merchant roundtable to align needs 
                and events. He calls for restoring weekly department-head meetings and infrastructure checklists, targeting a 45–55 percent public-safety 
                budget share, and creating a mental-health and recovery coalition to address homelessness and drug use. On governance, he says Millville’s 
                rare Walsh Act structure can work if leaders communicate and educate the public before any change. He advocates for community-driven election 
                forums through nonprofits and churches, a revived marketing plan linking the river, Arts District, Wheaton Arts, and Motorsports Park into a 
                two-day destination, and a balanced fiscal strategy that protects Millville’s AA bond rating while exploring new revenues like dispensaries 
                without privatizing core utilities. Across every issue he returns to the same principle: facts, communication, and steady leadership are the 
                foundation for Millville’s next chapter.

                    <strong>Quick Summary</strong>
                </summary>
                Joe Derella, a lifelong Millville resident and 1978 graduate of West Chester University with a degree in Health and Physical Education, 
                built his early career teaching and coaching at Millville High School before spending more than three decades managing sixteen outpatient 
                and physical-therapy facilities for NovaCare and later overseeing 500-plus employees in emergency services and occupational health at 
                Inspira. He retired in 2024 after forty-two years in healthcare and nearly three decades in public service—four years on the school board 
                (one as president), fifteen as city commissioner (eight as vice mayor and finance director), and nine as county commissioner and director 
                of administration and public safety. At the county level he served as president of the South Jersey Commissioners Association and vice 
                president of the New Jersey Association of Counties, building a network that continues to inform his pragmatic, team-based approach to 
                local governance.
                <br>
                <br>
                Derella’s record includes hands-on contributions to Millville’s transformation during the 2000s and 2010s — projects such as the Culver 
                Center, Levoy Theatre restoration, Buck Park, Union Lake Crossing, and New Jersey Motorsports Park — as well as county initiatives like the 
                CC Tech School expansion, Rowan College of South Jersey partnership, Veterans Cemetery Pavilion, 911 communications upgrade, and a Positive 
                Youth Coalition that cut juvenile crime by 40 percent. He points to bipartisan budget committees and long-standing cooperation with Republican 
                colleagues as proof that attitude and communication matter more than party lines. Now retired, he frames his campaign as a chance to mentor 
                younger officials and apply that experience to help “make Millville a little bit better.”
                <br>
                <br>
                His agenda centers on process, safety, and coordinated growth. He proposes a “fix-small-things-first” revitalization of the Arts District — 
                lighting from Buck to Sixth, clean streets, and visible police during Third Fridays — backed by a monthly merchant roundtable to align needs 
                and events. He calls for restoring weekly department-head meetings and infrastructure checklists, targeting a 45–55 percent public-safety 
                budget share, and creating a mental-health and recovery coalition to address homelessness and drug use. On governance, he says Millville’s 
                rare Walsh Act structure can work if leaders communicate and educate the public before any change. He advocates for community-driven election 
                forums through nonprofits and churches, a revived marketing plan linking the river, Arts District, Wheaton Arts, and Motorsports Park into a 
                two-day destination, and a balanced fiscal strategy that protects Millville’s AA bond rating while exploring new revenues like dispensaries 
                without privatizing core utilities. Across every issue he returns to the same principle: facts, communication, and steady leadership are the 
                foundation for Millville’s next chapter.

                <strong>Explanation</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
                Joe Derella is one of the few names in Cumberland County politics that virtually everyone has heard, yet few newer voters have had a clear 
                chance to learn about. A longtime public figure and former county commissioner, he brings decades of experience and familiarity within 
                established political circles. But that same longevity seems to have bred a comfort with traditional outreach methods that simply don’t 
                meet the informational standards expected today.
                <br><br>
                Derella attended the Four Seasons Forum and likely the Housing Authority event, but he did not participate in the InformTheVoteNJ Meet & Greet, 
                one of the most widely accessible public events of the season. He did, however, take part in the recorded Candidates Forum, which deserves 
                credit—very few candidates made that extra effort. Still, he has no active campaign website, no visible social-media presence (he has stated 
                openly that he doesn’t use it much), and no easily searchable interviews or detailed written platform available online (aside from ours based 
                on the candidate's forum).
                <br><br>
                This creates a stark divide between those already in the know and those trying to catch up. For residents who have followed local politics 
                for years, Derella’s record and reputation may speak for themselves. But for relative newcomers—or for voters who want to independently 
                verify information—the lack of centralized, public-facing material leaves a vacuum. The first and only time many voters could hear him 
                discuss current issues directly was at the Four Seasons Forum, which organizers prohibited from being recorded. The irony is hard to miss: 
                the one moment where fresh eyes could finally hear him speak, the information was locked behind the walls of a private event.
                <br><br>
                Derella’s case illustrates the structural gap in Millville and Cumberland County politics. When seasoned public officials rely on legacy 
                name recognition and offline conversations, newer residents and reform-minded voters are effectively shut out of the learning process. 
                Transparency should not depend on having been “around long enough” to know the players. In 2025, accessibility requires searchable records, 
                shareable media, and a consistent willingness to appear in public, recorded formats.
                <br><br>
                Overall rating: Average (Stable) — well-known and locally established, but with minimal current digital or documented transparency. In an era 
                where information equity defines civic participation, Derella’s campaign approach keeps newcomers eerily close to being on the outside looking in.

                administrator, solicitor, engineering, planning, and economic development offices—to present verified 
                facts that guide policy. Notes that “you can’t argue with a fact.” Encourages structured communication 
                within Sunshine Law limits, ensuring all commissioners share a common factual base before debates escalate.

                    to ad-hoc promises. Prioritizes coordination (City–Chamber–RRCA–nonprofits) and repeatable processes over slogans.

                    <strong>Levoy Theatre</strong> audience data and an updated (2011–13) destination plan rather than generic ad buys.
