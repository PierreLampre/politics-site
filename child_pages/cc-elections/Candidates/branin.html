    <h6 class="page-title">Newell Branin</h6>
    <p>
      Newell Branin is a lifelong Millville resident (55+ years) with nearly 40 years of professional experience in Emergency Services/Public Safety and 
      “countless” volunteer hours across local organizations. He’s running for City Commission on a message of teamwork, hard work, and culture 
      change—“new leadership, new faces, and new ideas”—with a stated commitment to act in the best interests of Millville and its citizens.
      <br><br>
      While his public platform is early-stage, Branin’s background suggests a practical, operations-minded perspective on public safety and community 
      service. In his campaign note, he emphasizes that commissioners must function as a team to make sound choices and restore pride in the city. He 
      frames the election as an opportunity to reset direction and bring more responsive, collaborative governance.
      <br><br>
      At this time, policy specifics (e.g., staffing targets, infrastructure priorities, budget approach) are not yet detailed publicly; this page will 
      be updated as more concrete proposals are released.

<!-- ====== RATING EXPLANATION MODAL ====== -->
<dialog id="Modal2" class="modal">

    <img src="../../../assets/x-icon-33.png" alt="an x icon - click to close the quick summary modal" id="close2" class="close">
    <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
    <h6 class="page-title">Newell Branin</h6>
    <p>
      Newell Branin’s campaign has remained visible in person but underdeveloped in structure. He has attended multiple community events, including the Four 
      Seasons Forum and the InformTheVoteNJ Meet & Greet, and likely the Housing Authority event. Those appearances demonstrate approachability and local 
      engagement—valuable traits in a crowded field. However, without a centralized campaign site, detailed issue statements, or campaign focused long-form 
      recorded content, 
      most of what voters know about him comes through brief encounters rather than a lasting election focused record.
      <br><br>
      Early in the season, Branin’s campaign consisted primarily of a Facebook page and limited written messaging. Since then, there has been little 
      substantive digital activity beyond promoting the brewery Meet & Greet and a fundraiser. A Google search reveals that he serves as President of the Millville Soccer 
      Association Board and is active as a council member at his Evangelical Lutheran Church—further evidence of his community roots—but these roles are 
      background context, not campaign outreach.
      <br><br>
      Interestingly, the same search shows that Branin has participated in several QBC interviews with Jim Quinn. Those appearances are noteworthy, but 
      they also highlight the distinction between general local media and election-focused coverage. Quinn’s platform, while valid and community-oriented, 
      is less focused on electoral accountability compared to the structured, issue-based format of InformTheVoteNJ. If Branin wanted those QBC appearances 
      to count toward transparency, it would have been simple—and effective—to share the specific interview links for inclusion in this repository. That 
      step alone would have strengthened his campaign’s traceable record.
      <br><br>
      This example underscores a recurring theme in Millville’s 2025 election cycle: candidates often rely on fragmented exposure rather than coordinated 
      press collaboration. It’s not enough to assume that voters will stumble across content buried on other pages or platforms. When information is 
      scattered across Facebook groups, small YouTube channels, or local radio segments, it becomes invisible to newer voters or those trying to make 
      informed comparisons. Campaigns have a responsibility to consolidate what’s out there—or, at minimum, ensure that credible local outlets receive 
      it directly.
      <br><br>
      Branin, like several others in the race, appears to be well known and generally well liked among people already “in the loop.” But for residents who 
      are new to local politics or prefer to review their election choices in a centralized, verifiable way, there’s little to evaluate. His accessibility 
      in person is genuine, but his campaign transparency remains limited by lack of follow-through and coordination.
      <br><br>
      Overall rating: Developing — personable and civically active, but reliant on scattered exposure rather than structured transparency. Better 
      coordination with press outlets and a centralized campaign presence would elevate his accessibility to the standard voters now expect.

      <p>
        “As some of you know, I have decided to run for the Millville City Commission in November. A lot of you have encouraged me to do this for a long 
        time and I have made the decision to help make a difference and hopefully change our city and move it in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am committed to my city and the citizens of Millville. I have been a lifelong Millville resident for over 55 years. I have a professional 
        background in Emergency Services/Public Safety for nearly 40 years. I have countless volunteer hours in numerous local organizations. I have two 
        adult daughters and a grandson.
      </p>
      <p>
        The City Commissioners are elected to work as a team to make the right choices for our citizens and the city. It takes teamwork and a lot of hard 
        work to make the best decisions. I want to make our city something that we can all be proud of again. When elected, I know I will have the best 
        interest of the city and our citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s time for change in Millville, new leadership, new faces and new ideas. Let’s change it together! Please share this page, tell your friends 
        & family and get the word out. Remember to vote in November!”
