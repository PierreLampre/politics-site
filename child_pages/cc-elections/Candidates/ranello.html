              <h6 class="page-title">Marissa Ranello</h6>
              <p>
                Ms. Ranello is a current Millville City Commissioner and is running for re-election. She has a degree in law and justice, and she was also a Millville School 
                board member for four years. She has been communicative with us in regards to addressing the issues put forward by Vice-Mayor Sooy in our 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3bTIfkFfx4&t=313s">interview with him</a>, which we summarized on our 
                <a href="https://www.informthevotenj.com/child_pages/cc-elections/millville_city_issues">Millville City Issues page</a>. Some of the stances she takes is 
                supporting the Nabb Ave Extension to help bring economic development to the city, addressing road safety and off-road vehicles by engaging the New Jersey Attorney 
                General, and addressing the current crime situation in the city by creating a stronger sense of community in the city which would make crime less appealing. We 
                suggest you scroll down and read her responses directly. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, after speaking with candidate Ranello on the phone, she informed us that the specific seat that is open on the board is the 
                seat in charge of the Parks and Public Property Department, which has its own specific set of issues. Some of these issues were made clear 
                in a recent <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1657190991204047/permalink/25141844292312053/?mibextid=xfxF2i&rdid=IIMt9F0NmPiPrBwo&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fp%2FsxM3r9pZQZGLK3x5%2F%3Fmibextid%3DxfxF2i">facebook post</a>, which include 
                keeping public spaces orderly and cleaning up parks and public areas to make them inviting.
                <br>
                <br>
                After some quick google searches and a quick scour of her political facebook,
                it seems as though she is from New York and moved to Millville. After experiencing some disillusionment about 
                <a href="https://www.thedailyjournal.com/story/news/2017/05/03/new-jersey-millville-street-brawl-commission/309535001/">problems facing Millville</a>, it appears 
                she decided to run for office and help solve the problems. She does appear to be very active and involved, as seen on her facebook, including addressing issues 
                such as 
                overdose prevention,

                <br>
                      Since her appointment to the Millville City Commission in April 2024, Marissa Ranello has been committed to 
                      restoring pride in the community. This mission involves tackling disorder, cleaning up parks and public spaces, and encouraging 
                      residents to actively participate in improving and caring for Millville. She is now seeking your vote to continue this important 
                      work. Learn more about what Marissa is doing here:

                Quoted directly from communication with Ranello, in response to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3bTIfkFfx4&t=313s">interview with Vice-Mayor Sooy</a> 
                which aimed to establish the current issues in Millville, which we have summarized on our <a href="https://www.informthevotenj.com/child_pages/cc-elections/millville_city_issues">Millville City Issues page</a>:
                <br>

                    <li>
                        Economic development in our rural area -
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I think it's vital to attract investments, create jobs, and increase overall economic activity. When you prioritize economic 
                        development, you're supporting the creation of new businesses and the expansion of existing ones. As the economy grows, it generates 
                        more tax revenue, allowing us to improve public services in Millville without needing to raise tax rates. Economic development 
                        addresses the root causes of financial challenges. With that said, there's a delicate balance. Most residents aren't going to 
                        support projects that could result in significant pollution or potentially harm the environment and public health. Balancing 
                        economic development with environmental and social responsibility is really important to me.

                        As we know, New Jersey legalized recreational marijuana through a voter-approved referendum in 2020. My primary concern with the 
                        legal cannabis market is that it has resulted in cannabis becoming more accessible to minors. Last year, the American Academy of 
                        Pediatrics released a report on edible cannabis exposures and acute toxicity in children under 6. The data revealed a dramatic 
                        increase in cases: from 207 in 2017 to 3,054 in 2021-an alarming rise of 1,375%. While the aim of regulating cannabis was to 
                        ensure quality control and safety, these numbers make me wonder if we're improving safety for adults but failing to protect 
                        children. Given these concerns, I'm uncertain if I'll ever be completely at ease with the widespread acceptance of cannabis. 
                        Nevertheless, it is now legal throughout the state, and it generates revenue and creates jobs. Currently, we do not allow 
                        dispensaries in Millville, although we have one growing facility. Regardless of individual opinions on marijuana, it is already 
                        present in our community. The reality is that cannabis provides a source of revenue, and we collect a 2% tax on it.

                        I believe the Nabb Avenue extension project will be highly beneficial for both the city and the county. It has the potential to 
                        drive new development, bringing significant advantages to Millville and the surrounding area. We've had a lot of different 
                        studies at this point. I'm hopeful that the city and the county can work together to bring this project to fruition.

                        Running for local office requires a significant time commitment, including attending meetings, participating in events, solving 
                        numerous problems, and communicating with both the public and various departments. If a candidate cannot dedicate the necessary 
                        time and effort, they should reconsider running for office. My advice to voters is to ask candidates about their platforms and 
                        the issues they plan to address. Find out what problems they aim to tackle, how they plan to address them, and what their 
                        specific strategies are. If a candidate can't provide clear answers, that's a red flag. This isn't about popularity; it's about 
                        choosing dedicated individuals who are genuinely committed to improving our city.

                        In 2022, this commission passed an ordinance banning the sale and dispensing of fuel for ATVs. A few months ago, we unanimously 
                        approved a resolution requesting more effective guidelines from the Attorney General's office to address ATV issues, but we have 
                        yet to receive a response. This issue extends beyond Millville, as neighboring cities are encountering similar problems. 
                        However, my primary concern is for Millville. Our police department urgently needs clear guidelines and support from the 
                        Attorney General.

                        Community is the backbone of Millville, shaping its identity, culture, and vitality. Without a strong community, 
                        we're fragmented and disconnected. My goal is to create a safer, more welcoming environment that encourages everyone to come 
                        together to celebrate our strengths and address the issues we face.

                        Many bail reform measures assume that individuals will engage with pretrial services, but this is not always the case. As a result, we often see 
                        individuals failing to appear for court dates, which leads to warrants and additional legal troubles. This creates emotional distress and feelings of 
                        vulnerability within communities like ours. To combat this, we need to make our environment less appealing to crime. Blighted neighborhoods often suffer
                        from weakened social cohesion and community ties, resulting in reduced crime reporting and a lack of trust among neighbors. In such environments, 
                        criminals may feel emboldened, believing they are less likely to be caught or face consequences. Addressing blight through community revitalization 
                        efforts can help break this cycle. By improving safety and fostering a sense of ownership and pride among residents, we can create a more resilient and 
                        secure community.
