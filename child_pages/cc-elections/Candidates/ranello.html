              <h6 class="page-title">Marissa Ranello</h6>
              <p>
                Marissa Ranello is a former Millville City Commissioner, current alternate on the Zoning Board of Adjustment, and advocate for local 
                revitalization through accountability and hands-on community involvement. She holds a Bachelor’s degree in Law and Justice from Rowan 
                University and has previously chaired the Board Governance and Policy Committee on the Millville Board of Education. Her experience across 
                education, public property management, and city governance has given her a strong grasp of local operations, budgeting, and policy 
                implementation.
                <br><br>
                Ranello’s campaign centers on a practical, neighborhood-first philosophy that prioritizes safety, cleanliness, and community investment as 
                the foundation for Millville’s long-term growth. Her agenda emphasizes situational crime prevention through improved lighting and securing 
                vacant properties, city cleanup and code enforcement, and partnerships for addiction and mental health recovery to address root causes of 
                instability. She views these efforts as prerequisites for meaningful economic development—arguing that businesses and families won’t invest 
                in a city that feels unsafe or neglected.
                <br><br>
                Claiming political independence, Ranello frames her run as “not with a party, but with purpose.” However, it is fairly well known that she 
                attends the bi-weekly republican breakfasts, which are now only open to Republicans. While the Millville City Commissioners race is technically 
                categorized as non-partisan, this type of gray-area messaging should be considered. That being said, she does
                stress hard work, accountability, and results 
                over ideology. Her recent campaign messaging also highlights the importance of volunteerism, saying that active community involvement gives 
                candidates a “boots-on-the-ground” perspective of what residents truly need—reinforcing her belief that leadership starts with service.
                <br><br>
                So far, Ranello has maintained consistent engagement through a public Facebook campaign page, her completed InformTheVoteNJ questionnaire, 
                and an appearance on J.T. Burks’ The Race to Millville City Commission interview series. These efforts reflect genuine transparency and 
                responsiveness, though voters would still benefit from a centralized website or longer-form public events to consolidate her message and 
                expand accessibility. (Refer to the transparency explanation below for more details.)

              <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
              <h6 class="page-title">Marissa Ranello</h6>
              <p>          
                Marissa Ranello has shown a consistent willingness to engage with InformTheVoteNJ across two election cycles, maintaining noticeable
                communication and responsiveness compared to some of her peers. She has answered questionnaires both last year and this year, attended 
                multiple public events—including the Four Seasons Forum and the InformTheVoteNJ Meet & Greet—and likely the Housing Authority event. 
                While she did not attend the recorded Candidates Forum, her overall visibility and cooperative track record place her a bit above the baseline 
                for candidate accessibility in Cumberland County.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, the 2025 season introduced some mixed results. Ranello may have made a substantive Facebook post about addressing homelessness 
                on October 6th—just before my October 8th social media review cutoff. This cutoff reflects a 
                realistic expectation: press and voters alike can only track so much information before Election Day. Campaigns that rely heavily on social 
                media risk leaving key updates buried under algorithms or lost to timing. As Ranello has shown herself to be communicative in the past, 
                this serves as a reminder that if candidates want something covered, they should proactively send it to the press rather than assume it 
                will be discovered. Transparency isn’t just about producing information—it’s about ensuring it reaches the public effectively.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another element worth addressing is tone and strategy. Ranello participated in one short interview with J.T. Burks for The Race to Millville 
                City Commission, while effectively declining other opportunities for longer-form interviews or radio appearances. There’s nothing inherently wrong with 
                choosing where to appear; every candidate has the right to decide how they manage their message. But when viewed alongside the broader 
                context—such as off-the-record discussions and the emergence of some campaign-season mudslinging—her selective approach creates an ambiguous 
                picture. Instead of going fully on the record to clarify her positions and reinforce her professionalism, Ranello’s campaign often straddled 
                a middle ground between accessibility and caution.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, it’s important to view her choices within the status quo of local politics. Millville—and Cumberland County more broadly—still 
                lacks a stable tradition of structured, recorded campaign events or unified press outreach. In that environment, candidates often end up 
                responding piecemeal to whichever opportunities arise. Ranello’s record remains stronger than some in terms of consistency, but she 
                represents the broader challenge facing the region: even the cooperative candidates are forced to navigate a system where transparency 
                depends more on initiative than infrastructure.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall rating: A Bit Above Average — steady and cooperative across cycles, but limited by selective participation and a campaign culture 
                that still normalizes fragmented communication.

                    <strong>Quick Summary</strong>
                </summary>
                Marissa Ranello is a former Millville City Commissioner, current alternate on the Zoning Board of Adjustment, and advocate for local 
                revitalization through accountability and hands-on community involvement. She holds a Bachelor’s degree in Law and Justice from Rowan 
                University and has previously chaired the Board Governance and Policy Committee on the Millville Board of Education. Her experience across 
                education, public property management, and city governance has given her a strong grasp of local operations, budgeting, and policy 
                implementation.
                <br><br>
                Ranello’s campaign centers on a practical, neighborhood-first philosophy that prioritizes safety, cleanliness, and community investment as 
                the foundation for Millville’s long-term growth. Her agenda emphasizes situational crime prevention through improved lighting and securing 
                vacant properties, city cleanup and code enforcement, and partnerships for addiction and mental health recovery to address root causes of 
                instability. She views these efforts as prerequisites for meaningful economic development—arguing that businesses and families won’t invest 
                in a city that feels unsafe or neglected.
                <br><br>
                Claiming political independence, Ranello frames her run as “not with a party, but with purpose.” However, it is fairly well known that she 
                attends the bi-weekly republican breakfasts, which are now only open to Republicans. While the Millville City Commissioners race is technically 
                categorized as non-partisan, this type of gray-area messaging should be considered. That being said, she does
                stress hard work, accountability, and results 
                over ideology. Her recent campaign messaging also highlights the importance of volunteerism, saying that active community involvement gives 
                candidates a “boots-on-the-ground” perspective of what residents truly need—reinforcing her belief that leadership starts with service.
                <br><br>
                So far, Ranello has maintained consistent engagement through a public Facebook campaign page, her completed InformTheVoteNJ questionnaire, 
                and an appearance on J.T. Burks’ The Race to Millville City Commission interview series. These efforts reflect genuine transparency and 
                responsiveness, though voters would still benefit from a centralized website or longer-form public events to consolidate her message and 
                expand accessibility. (Refer to the transparency explanation below for more details.)

                <strong>Explanation</strong>
            </summary>
            Marissa Ranello has shown a consistent willingness to engage with InformTheVoteNJ across two election cycles, maintaining noticeable
                communication and responsiveness compared to some of her peers. She has answered questionnaires both last year and this year, attended 
                multiple public events—including the Four Seasons Forum and the InformTheVoteNJ Meet & Greet—and likely the Housing Authority event. 
                While she did not attend the recorded Candidates Forum, her overall visibility and cooperative track record place her a bit above the baseline 
                for candidate accessibility in Cumberland County.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, the 2025 season introduced some mixed results. Ranello may have made a substantive Facebook post about addressing homelessness 
                on October 6th—just before my October 8th social media review cutoff. This cutoff reflects a 
                realistic expectation: press and voters alike can only track so much information before Election Day. Campaigns that rely heavily on social 
                media risk leaving key updates buried under algorithms or lost to timing. As Ranello has shown herself to be communicative in the past, 
                this serves as a reminder that if candidates want something covered, they should proactively send it to the press rather than assume it 
                will be discovered. Transparency isn’t just about producing information—it’s about ensuring it reaches the public effectively.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another element worth addressing is tone and strategy. Ranello participated in one short interview with J.T. Burks for The Race to Millville 
                City Commission, while effectively declining other opportunities for longer-form interviews or radio appearances. There’s nothing inherently wrong with 
                choosing where to appear; every candidate has the right to decide how they manage their message. But when viewed alongside the broader 
                context—such as off-the-record discussions and the emergence of some campaign-season mudslinging—her selective approach creates an ambiguous 
                picture. Instead of going fully on the record to clarify her positions and reinforce her professionalism, Ranello’s campaign often straddled 
                a middle ground between accessibility and caution.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, it’s important to view her choices within the status quo of local politics. Millville—and Cumberland County more broadly—still 
                lacks a stable tradition of structured, recorded campaign events or unified press outreach. In that environment, candidates often end up 
                responding piecemeal to whichever opportunities arise. Ranello’s record remains stronger than some in terms of consistency, but she 
                represents the broader challenge facing the region: even the cooperative candidates are forced to navigate a system where transparency 
                depends more on initiative than infrastructure.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall rating: A Bit Above Average — steady and cooperative across cycles, but limited by selective participation and a campaign culture 
                that still normalizes fragmented communication.

                        <p><strong>Background &amp; ties to Millville:</strong> <em>Marissa Ranello</em> has visited the area since childhood (1980s) and has lived in Millville ~10 years. She has a son in the public school system.</p>

                        <p><strong>Perspective &amp; priorities:</strong> Originally from Staten Island, NY, Ranello says an “outsider” lens helps her focus on <em>present realities</em> rather than mourning the past. She wants in-progress projects to keep moving and emphasizes that “there’s a lot of work to do.”</p>

                        <p><strong>Commission experience &amp; public safety:</strong> Served ~8 months on the City Commission (appointed, then special election). Highlights work on <em>lighting and safety</em>—arguing crime festers where conditions allow it (dark, dirty, neglected spaces). Public and officer safety are high priorities.</p>

                        <p><strong>19 candidates &amp; functional government:</strong> The crowded field <em>encourages</em> her—it shows people care. She hopes voters choose five who can collaborate and stick with their seats for a full term. Advocates pragmatic <em>6-month/1-year/4-year</em> departmental plans and stability after years of turnover.</p>

                        <p><strong>Clean, safe, educated—and market the city:</strong> Find common ground: clean streets, safe neighborhoods, strong schools, reasonable taxes. To attract business, <em>market Millville</em> better and clean it up. She cites a “Millville Means Business” video with very low views as a missed promotion opportunity.</p>

                        <p><strong>Closing message:</strong> “<em>Stay.</em>” Don’t give up on Millville—plant “seeds of commonality,” pitch in, and grow with the community.</p>

                <h4 style="color: blue;">Situational Crime Prevention</h4>
                <p>
                    Make Millville less attractive to crime by improving lighting, securing vacant properties, and strengthening community ties.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: blue;">City Cleanup</h4>
                <p>
                    Launch aggressive cleanup campaigns focused on litter removal, illegal dumping, and holding owners of neglected properties accountable.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: blue;">Economic Development</h4>
                <p>
                    Make Millville a place people want to invest in by focusing on safety, cleanliness, and quality of life improvements.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: blue;">Partnerships for Addiction and Mental Health Recovery</h4>
                <p>
                    Coordinate efforts to expand access to treatment and support for individuals facing addiction and mental health challenges, in line with recent federal initiatives.

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Bottom Line</h4>
            <div class="experience can-sec">
                Businesses and families are not going to invest in a city that feels unsafe or neglected. If we want Millville to grow, we have to restore 
                a sense of safety and pride in our neighborhoods. I’ve had honest differences of opinion with past and current candidates on this issue. 
                Some believe the best way forward is to attract businesses first and hope that the rest will follow. I understand that view, but I see it 
                differently because I’ve seen that approach fail. When we try to build economic growth on top of neglect, it doesn’t work. The city needs 
                to be clean, safe, and cared for before people will want to live here, raise families, or open businesses. It really is the chicken and the 
                egg. In my view, cleanup and community investment have to come first if we want lasting progress.

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Party Affiliation and Ideology</h4>
            <div class="experience can-sec">
                In Millville, we have nonpartisan elections. I’m not running with a party. I’m running with purpose. My values are rooted in hard work, 
                accountability, and service. That’s how I’ll lead. Politics can get noisy, but most people just want to see their city clean, safe, and 
                functional. I’m focused on that.

                Quoted directly from communication with Ranello, in response to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3bTIfkFfx4&t=313s">interview with Vice-Mayor Sooy</a> 
                which aimed to establish the current issues in Millville, which we have summarized on our <a href="https://www.informthevotenj.com/child_pages/cc-elections/millville_city_issues">Millville City Issues page</a>:

                        Economic development in our rural area -
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I think it's vital to attract investments, create jobs, and increase overall economic activity. When you prioritize economic 
                        development, you're supporting the creation of new businesses and the expansion of existing ones. As the economy grows, it generates 
                        more tax revenue, allowing us to improve public services in Millville without needing to raise tax rates. Economic development 
                        addresses the root causes of financial challenges. With that said, there's a delicate balance. Most residents aren't going to 
                        support projects that could result in significant pollution or potentially harm the environment and public health. Balancing 
                        economic development with environmental and social responsibility is really important to me.

                        Cannabis as a potential source of tax revenue -
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As we know, New Jersey legalized recreational marijuana through a voter-approved referendum in 2020. My primary concern with the 
                        legal cannabis market is that it has resulted in cannabis becoming more accessible to minors. Last year, the American Academy of 
                        Pediatrics released a report on edible cannabis exposures and acute toxicity in children under 6. The data revealed a dramatic 
                        increase in cases: from 207 in 2017 to 3,054 in 2021-an alarming rise of 1,375%. While the aim of regulating cannabis was to 
                        ensure quality control and safety, these numbers make me wonder if we're improving safety for adults but failing to protect 
                        children. Given these concerns, I'm uncertain if I'll ever be completely at ease with the widespread acceptance of cannabis. 
                        Nevertheless, it is now legal throughout the state, and it generates revenue and creates jobs. Currently, we do not allow 
                        dispensaries in Millville, although we have one growing facility. Regardless of individual opinions on marijuana, it is already 
                        present in our community. The reality is that cannabis provides a source of revenue, and we collect a 2% tax on it.

                        Nabb Ave Extension -
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I believe the Nabb Avenue extension project will be highly beneficial for both the city and the county. It has the potential to 
                        drive new development, bringing significant advantages to Millville and the surrounding area. We've had a lot of different 
                        studies at this point. I'm hopeful that the city and the county can work together to bring this project to fruition.

                        Voter Awareness and Civic Engagement -
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Running for local office requires a significant time commitment, including attending meetings, participating in events, solving 
                        numerous problems, and communicating with both the public and various departments. If a candidate cannot dedicate the necessary 
                        time and effort, they should reconsider running for office. My advice to voters is to ask candidates about their platforms and 
                        the issues they plan to address. Find out what problems they aim to tackle, how they plan to address them, and what their 
                        specific strategies are. If a candidate can't provide clear answers, that's a red flag. This isn't about popularity; it's about 
                        choosing dedicated individuals who are genuinely committed to improving our city.

                        Road safety and off-road vehicles -
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 2022, this commission passed an ordinance banning the sale and dispensing of fuel for ATVs. A few months ago, we unanimously 
                        approved a resolution requesting more effective guidelines from the Attorney General's office to address ATV issues, but we have 
                        yet to receive a response. This issue extends beyond Millville, as neighboring cities are encountering similar problems. 
                        However, my primary concern is for Millville. Our police department urgently needs clear guidelines and support from the 
                        Attorney General.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Community is the backbone of Millville, shaping its identity, culture, and vitality. Without a strong community, 
                        we're fragmented and disconnected. My goal is to create a safer, more welcoming environment that encourages everyone to come 
                        together to celebrate our strengths and address the issues we face.

                        Situational Crime Prevention - 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Many bail reform measures assume that individuals will engage with pretrial services, but this is not always the case. As a result, we often see 
                        individuals failing to appear for court dates, which leads to warrants and additional legal troubles. This creates emotional distress and feelings of 
                        vulnerability within communities like ours. To combat this, we need to make our environment less appealing to crime. Blighted neighborhoods often suffer
                        from weakened social cohesion and community ties, resulting in reduced crime reporting and a lack of trust among neighbors. In such environments, 
                        criminals may feel emboldened, believing they are less likely to be caught or face consequences. Addressing blight through community revitalization 
                        efforts can help break this cycle. By improving safety and fostering a sense of ownership and pride among residents, we can create a more resilient and 
                        secure community.
