              <h6 class="page-title">John P. Capizola</h6>
              <p>          

                John P. “Johnny” Capizola, Jr. is a lifelong Vineland resident, educator, coach, and small-business owner now seeking a full 
                elected term on the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners. He was appointed by the County Democratic Committee in January 
                2023 to fill an unexpired seat and says the experience has helped him “get his feet wet” in county government while learning 
                how to navigate what he describes as a less partisan, more collaborative board.
                <br>
                <br>
                Capizola has taught health and physical education in Vineland Public Schools for more than 22 years, holds a master’s degree in 
                Educational Leadership from Wilmington University (summa cum laude), and is certified as a New Jersey principal and supervisor. 
                Outside the classroom he has coached youth sports across Vineland and Atlantic City, served on the Vineland Midget Football 
                League board, and run small businesses including Serafina’s Ristorante & Pizzeria and Parkside Laundromat—experience he says 
                informs his interest in attracting new business and keeping residents in the county.
                <br>
                <br>
                His campaign materials highlight broad priorities: improving educational opportunities, protecting natural resources, practicing 
                fiscal responsibility with taxpayer dollars, enhancing roads and broadband, supporting senior housing and health care, and 
                expanding recreational amenities. At a 2023 candidates forum he also spoke about the need for better county communication 
                (including the launch of a new website) and a stronger local press, and stated his opposition to school vouchers.
                <br>
                <br>
                So far, however, public information about Capizola’s platform and appearances has been limited mostly to a joint Facebook page 
                with running mate Yolanda Garcia Balicki. Beyond that page there are little to no policy specifics, event listings, or clearly advertised 
                ways for voters to interact directly with the campaign. This mirrors my own repeated attempts to reach out, which have sometimes 
                been routed between party figures or met with silence. Voters who value his résumé and community roots may find much to like, 
                but those seeking detailed plans or reliable public engagement may still be waiting for more concrete outreach as the campaign 
                progresses.

              <p>          

                Transparency & Accessibility Rating Explanation (as of 9/11/25)
                <br>
                <br>
                John Capizola brings a long record of local teaching, coaching, and small-business experience, and he was appointed to the Board 
                of Commissioners in 2023. Yet despite that background, his 2025 campaign has so far offered only broad themes and a joint 
                Facebook page with running mate Yolanda Garcia-Balicki—leaving little in the way of detailed, easily accessible issues based information.
                <br>
                <br>
                Repeated outreach over the past two years—including emails, letters, questionnaires, and attempts to attend public events—has 
                resulted in inconsistent communication: shifting answers about who manages the campaign, no regularly advertised public meetings, 
                and me even being escorted out of a meet-and-greet. The net effect is that voters looking for more than a résumé still lack a clear, 
                public-facing outline of where Capizola stands on major county issues.
                <br>
                <br>
                This rating isn’t totally meant as a personal critique; Cumberland County as a whole still lacks a consistently robust system for 
                providing voters with candidate information. But at a time when transparency and accessibility are essential, Capizola and county 
                Democrats have put themselves in a position where their message is hard for the average voter to find. The door remains open for 
                him and his running mate to improve this by sharing substantive plans—whether through questionnaires, interviews, a comprehensive 
                campaign website,  or scheduled campaign events—so that residents can confidently assess how they would handle the county’s 
                challenges.

                If you want coverage somewhere in between, like interviews that range from introductory to moderately pressing, watch the interviews. Choose your own adventure.</li>

                After reaching out to Capizola multiple times with no substantive response, it is unclear what his current policy positions are. However, we might be able to infer the 
                following from last year's efforts:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supports armed security in schools. (learned from the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School)</li>

                <div class="experience can-sec">
                    When asked what makes him most qualified to serve as Commissioner at the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School,
                    Capizola spoke about how he is just getting his feet wet as an appointed Commissioner. He seemed to convey that he is 
                    learning a lot about county politics quickly and has watched his board of commissioners transform from very partisan to
                    mostly non-partisan during his tenure. He hopes to continue that trend. He wants to help attract people who have left the 
                    county to come back by helping to entice new business, which he can help with through his business experience. He also seemed 
                    to imply that he may be a rising star as he may be the new assistant principal at the school where he works.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When asked about improving transparency and accountability, Capizola spoke about needing to communicate better with the 
                    community, the new county website which should be done soon, and needing reporters in the county.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At one point during the forum, Capizola made it clear that he is against school vouchers.
