              <h6 class="page-title">John P. Capizola, Jr.</h6>
              <p>Former Commissioner Capizola is a democrat with approximately one year of experience serving as a 
                commissioner. Some quick points of note are that he seems to have a moderate stance on gun control, supports armed security in schools, and he supported 
                the middle mile broadband grant. He also has spoken against school vouchers, he hopes to make local politics less partisan, and he supports better transparency 
                and communication between the government and constituents. In terms of specific agenda should he get elected, his focus seems to be to improve roads/infrastructure/broadband, 
                to support senior housing and healthcare, and to provide recreational advancements. 
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122116637984284447&set=a.122109417842284447">Facebook source</a>. Also, Austino and Capizola have openly supported the Harris/Walz 
                ticket on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamrileyaustinocapizola/posts/pfbid02TfP87cUqFVnRcghD2B2azdWREc7QMw6twNeWtgZYQ1obVZwmXvrB2McQgDrfFEHxl?rdid=kpuRhdj1uAT0qrfm">facebook</a>, 
                so it follows that Austino/Capizola will support and/or implement that agenda, unless they clarify otherwise in the future. There was also a facebook post on August 13th which 
                additionally states his agenda will include educational excellence, environmental sustainability, and fiscal responsibility. Click the red x at the top of this box and then 
                scroll down down for more in-depth information and sources.

            <div class="agenda-per-party-site">
                After reaching out to various members of the CumberlandNJ Dems, it is unclear how the Democrat party agenda specifically and currently applies to Cumberland County. However, 
                we might be able to infer the following things from last year's messaging:
                <ul>
                    <li>Support Senior housing and Healthcare Services.</li>
                    <li>Provide county recreational advancements, building a county indoor sports facility and swim center and improving county recreation areas.</li>
                    <li>Support state of the art correctional facility, by improving conditions and programs and drive long standing issues with facility to closure. Also wishes to reduce 
                        cost and tax burden of facility.</li>

            <div class="policy-positions">
                After reaching out to Capizola multiple times with no substantive response, it is unclear what his current policy positions are. However, we might be able to infer the 
                following from last year's efforts:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supports armed security in schools. (learned from the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School)</li>

            <h4 class="sub-heading">experience</h4>
            <div class="experience">
                Cumberland County Democrats chose Capizola to serve out an unexpired, one-year term on the county Board of Commissioners, replacing the 
                resigning Castellini.  Capizola was sworn in January 24th, 2023.

                <br>
                He majored in health and physical education. He has a master's degree in Educational Leadership. He has certifications to be a New Jersey principal and 
                Supervisor. He also has business experience in regards to owning a restaurant and a laundromat.

            <h4 class="sub-heading">2023 Candidates Forum Statements</h4>
            <div class="experience">
                When asked what makes him most qualified to serve as Commissioner at the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School,
                Capizola spoke about how he is just getting his feet wet as an appointed Commissioner. He seemed to convey that he is 
                learning a lot about county politics quickly and has watched his board of commissioners transform from very partisan to
                mostly non-partisan during his tenure. He hopes to continue that trend. He wants to help attract people who have left the 
                county to come back by helping to entice new business, which he can help with through his business experience. He also seemed 
                to imply that he may be a rising star as he may be the new assistant principal at the school where he works.
                <br>
                <br>
                When asked about improving transparency and accountability, Capizola spoke about needing to communicate better with the 
                community, the new county website which should be done soon, and needing reporters in the county.
                <br>
                <br>
                At one point during the forum, Capizola made it clear that he is against school vouchers.
