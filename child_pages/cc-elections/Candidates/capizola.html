              <h6 class="page-title">John P. Capizola, Jr.</h6>
              <p>Former Commissioner Capizola is a democrat with approximately one year of experience serving as a 
                commissioner. He seems to be running with former Sheriff Austino 'against' Perella and Smith. Without having any direct way to verify, we 
                assume by surface level comparison that Austino and Capizola would be more center-left than Smith and Perella. Some quick points of note are that 
                he seems to have a moderate stance on gun control, supports armed security in schools, and supported the middle mile broadband grant. He also has 
                spoken against school vouchers, hoping to make local politics less partisan, and supporting better transparency and communication between the 
                government and constituents. Scroll down for more in-depth information and sources.

                Cumberland County Democrats chose Capizola to serve out an unexpired, one-year term on the county Board of Commissioners, replacing the 
                resigning Castellini.  Capizola was sworn in January 24th, 2023.

            <div class="experience">
                When asked what makes him most qualified to serve as Commissioner at the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School,
                Capizola spoke about how he is just getting his feet wet as an appointed Commissioner. He seemed to convey that he is 
                learning a lot about county politics quickly and has watched his board of commissioners transform from very partisan to
                mostly non-partisan during his tenure. He hopes to continue that trend. He wants to help attract people who have left the 
                county to come back by helping to entice new business, which he can help with through his business experience. He also seemed 
                to imply that he may be a rising star as he may be the new assistant principal at the school where he works.
                <br>
                <br>
                When asked about improving transparency and accountability, Capizola spoke about needing to communicate better with the 
                community, the new county website which should be done soon, and needing reporters in the county.
                <br>
                <br>
                At one point during the forum, Capizola made it clear that he is against school vouchers.
