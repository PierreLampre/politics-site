              <p>          

                John P. Capizola, Jr. is a former Cumberland County Commissioner, appointed in 2023 to serve a one-year term. He brings a background in education, with over two decades as a health 
                and physical education teacher, a masterâ€™s in Educational Leadership, and certifications to serve as a principal and supervisor. He also has small business experience as a former 
                restaurant and laundromat owner.
                <br>
                <br>
                In past campaigns and public forums, Capizola has expressed support for educational excellence, fiscal responsibility, environmental sustainability, and community 
                revitalizationâ€”emphasizing infrastructure, recreation, senior services, and broadband access. He has also voiced support for armed security in schools and opposition to 
                school vouchers. At the 2023 Candidates Forum, he spoke about wanting to attract former residents back to the county by boosting business opportunities and praised the shift 
                from partisanship to collaboration during his short time on the board.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, <strong>his current campaign messaging remains unclear.</strong> Aside from a basic biographical profile, <strong>no updated policy stances, platform materials, or 
                detailed comparisons to his opponent have been shared.</strong> While past statements offer a rough sketch of his views, they should not be assumed to reflect his current 
                priorities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Capizola has been contacted multiple times with opportunities to share updated information but has yet to provide a substantive response. Voters seeking detailed and current insights into his positions may find it difficult to evaluate his candidacy without greater transparency.

              <h6 class="page-title">John P. Capizola</h6>
              <p>          

                Former Commissioner Capizola has been around the political scene for several years and was appointed mid-year for his prior term as a county commissioner. With his brief time 
                in office and prior campaigns, we can reasonably assume heâ€™s familiar with the issues facing Cumberland County and the public expectations of a candidate running in 2025.
                <br>
                <br>
                Which makes it all the more surprising that his public-facing materials don't reflect that experience. His official bio doesn't even mention his time as commissionerâ€”an 
                omission that raises questions about how seriously his campaign is treating voter outreach this cycle.
                <br>
                <br>
                To his credit, Capizola is known for logging countless hours door-knocking and attending political events during previous campaigns. But at a time when voters are increasingly 
                turning to digital platforms for information, and when tools like Wix can host a campaign site in an afternoon, this traditional approach feels out of step. A 
                well-organized candidate in 2025 should be able to share their positions widely and efficientlyâ€”not just face-to-face with those lucky enough to get a knock on their door, 
                have spare time to attend events, or listen to phased out radio stations.
                <br>
                <br>
                And thatâ€™s part of what makes this accessibility issue so glaring: Capizola lives within minutes of us. If, after two years of proactively reaching out to local 
                candidatesâ€”including those in our own neighborhoodâ€”we still donâ€™t have basic answers, what should the average voter expect?
                <br>
                <br>
                At this stage in the game, candidates who know each other and have both served in public roles should be capable of articulating not just their own stance on key issues like 
                the Nabb Ave Extension, but also how their platform compares to their opponentâ€™s. Whether framed as a neutral comparison or a pointed critique, clarity is what mattersâ€”and 
                right now, voters donâ€™t have it.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, the rating is not permanent. Candidates with low transparency scores can improve them by clearly documenting their campaign messaging: filling out questionnaires, 
                maintaining a basic campaign website, participating in podcast-style interviews, and sharing that information with us for public access. Itâ€™s not about giving us 
                attention, candidates can create the content how they wantâ€” but the content should exist and be easily accessible to voters.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ultimately, the root problem is often not a refusal to cooperate, but the absence of clear information in the first place. When representatives speculate that we're trying 
                to "break a story," or accuse us of partisan motivations, they miss the point entirely. Itâ€™s 2025. The county should already be doing a better job helping residents 
                understand their options for leadership. This platform simply serves as a proof-of-concept to fill the gap, though the county probably should do it themselves after getting 
                the state legislature to change the laws to allow it.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, Capizola receives a below-average rating for transparency and accessibility.

                After reaching out to Capizola multiple times with no substantive response, it is unclear what his current policy positions are. However, we might be able to infer the 
                following from last year's efforts:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supports armed security in schools. (learned from the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Capizola and Austino also brought up an issue regarding South Ave in Bridgeton while on the campaign trail:

                however it seems as though the issue is in the process of being handled:

                <div class="experience can-sec">
                    When asked what makes him most qualified to serve as Commissioner at the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School,
                    Capizola spoke about how he is just getting his feet wet as an appointed Commissioner. He seemed to convey that he is 
                    learning a lot about county politics quickly and has watched his board of commissioners transform from very partisan to
                    mostly non-partisan during his tenure. He hopes to continue that trend. He wants to help attract people who have left the 
                    county to come back by helping to entice new business, which he can help with through his business experience. He also seemed 
                    to imply that he may be a rising star as he may be the new assistant principal at the school where he works.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When asked about improving transparency and accountability, Capizola spoke about needing to communicate better with the 
                    community, the new county website which should be done soon, and needing reporters in the county.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At one point during the forum, Capizola made it clear that he is against school vouchers.
