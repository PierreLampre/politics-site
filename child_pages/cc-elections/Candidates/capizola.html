              <h6 class="page-title">John P. Capizola</h6>
              <p>          

                John Capizola, Jr., a former Cumberland County Commissioner and longtime educator, is once again seeking office—this time on a joint Democratic ticket with attorney 
                Yolanda Garcia Balicki. The pair launched a Facebook page emphasizing their goal to “restore a successful county government” modeled on previous Democratic 
                leadership: lower taxes, private-sector growth, and expanded education programs.
                <br>
                <br>
                While those goals are broadly appealing, the campaign has yet to offer voters clear specifics. As of this writing, there are no event listings on the county 
                party’s official website, no substantial policy breakdowns on their joint Facebook page, and only sparse mentions of public appearances—such as a same-day post from 
                Balicki about greeting voters at a local flea market with no time specified. Voters hoping to learn more are instead met with general political commentary and 
                distractions on the Democrat facebook group from party and campaign affiliates, rather than useful, local election material. For engaged 
                residents trying to stay informed, this kind of digital noise adds to the challenge of getting straight answers.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s important to clarify: this isn’t about picking on any one candidate. But in Capizola’s case, a little tension over the years has emerged—not necessarily 
                from personal conflict, but from a pattern of non-engagement. His prior appointment to the Board of Commissioners wasn’t the result of an election, and in an 
                environment where transparency matters, a clearer explanation of why he was appointed—and what he did with that opportunity—feels warranted. When a candidate has 
                the advantage of incumbency or prior experience, it’s reasonable for voters to expect a corresponding willingness to participate in open forums and respond to 
                outreach. So far, that hasn’t materialized.
                <br>
                <br>
                With two commissioner seats open and only three Democrats in the race, Capizola is statistically likely to appear on the general election ballot. That reality 
                raises expectations. Voters deserve more than a résumé—they deserve clarity on policy, meaningful contrasts with the Republican incumbents, and reliable 
                communication that invites public accountability.

              <h6 class="page-title">John P. Capizola</h6>
              <p>          

                Former Commissioner Capizola has been around the political scene for several years and was appointed mid-year for his prior term as a county commissioner. With his brief time 
                in office and prior campaigns, we can reasonably assume he’s familiar with the issues facing Cumberland County and the public expectations of a candidate running in 2025.
                <br>
                <br>
                Which makes it all the more surprising that his public-facing materials don't reflect that experience. His official bio doesn't even mention his time as commissioner—an 
                omission that raises questions about how seriously his campaign is treating voter outreach this cycle.
                <br>
                <br>
                To his credit, Capizola is known for logging countless hours door-knocking and attending political events during previous campaigns. But at a time when voters are increasingly 
                turning to digital platforms for information, and when tools like Wix can host a campaign site in an afternoon, this traditional approach feels out of step. A 
                well-organized candidate in 2025 should be able to share their positions widely and efficiently—not just face-to-face with those lucky enough to get a knock on their door, 
                have spare time to attend events, or listen to phased out radio stations.
                <br>
                <br>
                And that’s part of what makes this accessibility issue so glaring: Capizola lives within minutes of us. If, after two years of proactively reaching out to local 
                candidates—including those in our own neighborhood—we still don’t have basic answers, what should the average voter expect?
                <br>
                <br>
                At this stage in the game, candidates who know each other and have both served in public roles should be capable of articulating not just their own stance on key issues like 
                the Nabb Ave Extension, but also how their platform compares to their opponent’s. Whether framed as a neutral comparison or a pointed critique, clarity is what matters—and 
                right now, voters don’t have it.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, the rating is not permanent. Candidates with low transparency scores can improve them by clearly documenting their campaign messaging: filling out questionnaires, 
                maintaining a basic campaign website, participating in podcast-style interviews, and sharing that information with us for public access. It’s not about giving us 
                attention, candidates can create the content how they want— but the content should exist and be easily accessible to voters.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ultimately, the root problem is often not a refusal to cooperate, but the absence of clear information in the first place. When representatives speculate that we're trying 
                to "break a story," or accuse us of partisan motivations, they miss the point entirely. It’s 2025. The county should already be doing a better job helping residents 
                understand their options for leadership. This platform simply serves as a proof-of-concept to fill the gap, though the county probably should do it themselves after getting 
                the state legislature to change the laws to allow it.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, Capizola receives a below-average rating for transparency and accessibility.

                <li>Each candidate page is built from multiple sources: campaign websites, social media, interviews, public appearances, and official documents where available.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>The original goal was to serve strictly as an objective collection of information in one repository. Those aforementioned information resources are on the site, so you are 
                  always welcome to ignore our analysis and simply do your own.</li>
                <br>
                <li>However, because many campaigns did not provide basic materials (such as functional websites or clear agendas), this project has also grown into providing press 
                  coverage and analysis.</li>
                  <br>
                <li>Press coverage and analysis cannot ever be 100% neutral by nature. What you’ll find here is a combination of: 
                    <ul style="margin-top:6px; line-height:1.5;">
                        <li><b>Objective collection</b> – links, documents, transcripts, videos, and campaign content.</li>
                        <li><b>Press services</b> – interviews, outreach attempts, and first-hand reporting.</li>
                        <li><b>Analysis and commentary</b> – moderate opinions meant to help voters who won’t have time to “go down the rabbit holes” themselves.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>The point of view here is informed by two years of doing the legwork of online research, boots on the ground research, and networking. 
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  For example: in 2025, one might think that every candidate ought to have a working campaign website and the county would have specific campaign events to ensure voters can 
                  interact with potential leadership/representation before they're hired to lead/represent. But since that often isn’t the case, my perspective comes from 
                  asking for this information repeatedly, realizing the depth of the problem, and showing how it plays out in practice.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Think of this site as a <b>repository first</b>, a <b>press surrogate second</b>, and a <b>moderate guide third</b>. The combination isn’t perfect, but it’s an 
                  honest attempt to make sense of what’s missing locally and help voters access more than they otherwise could, or at least a lot more efficiently.</li>

                After reaching out to Capizola multiple times with no substantive response, it is unclear what his current policy positions are. However, we might be able to infer the 
                following from last year's efforts:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supports armed security in schools. (learned from the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School)</li>

                Capizola and Austino also brought up an issue regarding South Ave in Bridgeton while on the campaign trail:

                Cumberland County Democrats chose Capizola to serve out an unexpired, one-year term on the county Board of Commissioners, replacing the 
                resigning Castellini.  Capizola was sworn in January 24th, 2023.

                <div class="experience can-sec">
                    When asked what makes him most qualified to serve as Commissioner at the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School,
                    Capizola spoke about how he is just getting his feet wet as an appointed Commissioner. He seemed to convey that he is 
                    learning a lot about county politics quickly and has watched his board of commissioners transform from very partisan to
                    mostly non-partisan during his tenure. He hopes to continue that trend. He wants to help attract people who have left the 
                    county to come back by helping to entice new business, which he can help with through his business experience. He also seemed 
                    to imply that he may be a rising star as he may be the new assistant principal at the school where he works.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When asked about improving transparency and accountability, Capizola spoke about needing to communicate better with the 
                    community, the new county website which should be done soon, and needing reporters in the county.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At one point during the forum, Capizola made it clear that he is against school vouchers.
