              <p>
                
              Current Council President Spinelli has an extensive resume, and most notably for his re-election bid he served on the school board for 3 years 
              including its finance committee, the council for 12 years including 4 years a president, and numerous community based positions from being an 
              educator/principal, to a basketball coach, volunteer and liason to his parish, and much more. Given his current role as council president, he 
              has a detailed agenda including bringing better paying jobs and businesses to the city in a controlled manner, update infrastructure such as 
              water/sewer/storm water drains, continue to negotiate fair and equitable contracts for employees, and more. He highlights that he has been in 
              leadership positions his whole life and that he has been successful in his current role, so he proposes that a continuation of his tenure will 
              continue to bring success. He also presents himself as a good balance of being detailed oriented and a down-to-earth approach that helps residents 
              solve problems that they couldn't otherwise solve.

                Presently the City administration and council work well together to move our city forward and make it a better living experience for the 
                citizens of Vineland, this will continue under a new term if elected.  Always looking for new business and industry to increase opportunities 
                for local people to get higher paying jobs.  Continue to improve our recreation areas for a better experience for our elderly and youth.  
                Work on a succession plan for key positions in the administration so retirements will not have a major impact on city services.

                I have had success in reaching out to the electorate and trying to help people with issues that they could not get resolved.  I have had 
                leadership experience in every position I have held in my life including the board of Education in Vineland, City Council, social Clubs and 
                the teachers union when I was employed.  I bring a down to earth attitude to fixing problems within the purview of my position.  I have shown 
                leadership as the President of city council while holding the position or just a member of the governing body.  I am a person of detail and 
                when there is a problem I work hard to find a fair and equitable solution to fix it.
