              <p>          

                Chris Konawel is a first-term Gloucester County Commissioner overseeing the Department of Government Services. A small business owner with experience in the automotive and real 
                estate sectors, Konawel emphasizes job creation, economic growth, and limited government. He is also a vocal supporter of Second Amendment rights and has consistently aligned 
                himself with grassroots Republican messaging.
                <br>
                <br>
                While Konawel does not maintain a formal campaign website or structured platform, he has made his views known at Republican events—particularly at the bi-weekly GOP breakfasts. 
                However, those gatherings recently shifted to exclude Democrats and members of the press, limiting public visibility into what used to be more accessible venues for civic engagement.
                <br>
                <br>
                Recently, Konawel posted on Facebook about a serious ongoing issue in Gloucester County, sharing insights into how he’s working to address the matter. This kind of direct 
                communication with constituents could signal the start of a more active campaign effort—especially given that he is currently running unopposed in the primary. That said, it’s too 
                early to say for sure. Since InformTheVoteNJ only began covering his activity this year and has not yet fully reviewed his social media history, it remains unclear whether this 
                post is part of a broader strategic push or simply a one-off moment of constituent outreach.
                <br>
                <br>
                For now, while Konawel remains visible within his political circles, his public-facing campaign remains limited. A more structured platform, clearer digital communication, or 
                participation in voter-facing interviews would go a long way in helping the broader electorate understand how he intends to lead moving forward.

              <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
              <h6 class="page-title">Chris Konawell</h6>
              <p>          
                Chris Konawel, a Republican candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly in Legislative District 3, currently does not maintain a dedicated campaign website or centralized policy 
                platform. His primary digital presence is a Facebook page that, while active, contains limited structured information about his legislative priorities or public schedule. An 
                outreach message from InformTheVoteNJ was seen but left unanswered, and no alternative form of contact has been offered.
                <br>
                <br>
                Konawel has made at least one known public appearance during the 2025 campaign cycle, speaking briefly at a Republican breakfast event. While his remarks were general and 
                campaign-lite, they at least placed him ahead of candidates who have made no public statements at all. During that same event, InformTheVoteNJ approached him directly to invite 
                participation in our voter information process. He acknowledged the request but deferred to his campaign manager, with no follow-up or commitment since.
                <br>
                <br>
                While Konawel recently used Facebook to update constituents on a serious county issue, it’s unclear whether that post marks the beginning of more robust campaign outreach or was 
                simply a moment of situational responsiveness. Since we only began tracking him this year and have not fully reviewed his posting history, the pattern is not yet clear.
                <br>
                <br>
                Adding to the challenge is the recent shift in access to the bi-weekly Republican breakfasts, which have traditionally served as a consistent space for GOP candidates to 
                communicate with the public. These events are now closed to Democrats and members of the press, narrowing visibility into what used to be an informal window into candidate 
                thinking. For candidates like Konawel—who have no campaign website, no structured platform, and no open interview participation—this restriction further limits what voters can 
                learn unless they’re already within the party’s inner circle.
                <br>
                <br>
                All four candidates in LD-3 (two Republicans and two Democrats) are currently running unopposed in the primary, meaning they are all expected to appear on the general election 
                ballot. This gives each of them a valuable opportunity to begin communicating their platforms early and clearly. So far, Konawel has not taken meaningful steps in that direction.
                <br>
                <br>
                Given the limited online engagement, lack of follow-up to outreach, and minimal public platform details, Konawel currently receives a “low-to-below-average” transparency rating. 
                A more structured digital presence, public response to outreach, or participation in interview-based voter education efforts could substantially improve that score heading into 
                the general election.

                Chris Konawel has not published a formal campaign platform for his current bid for the General Assembly in Legislative District 3. However, his public remarks and past 
                service offer insight into his legislative priorities. As a Gloucester County Commissioner and small business owner, Konawel has consistently emphasized economic growth, 
                efficient government, and a business-friendly climate. His affiliations with the New Jersey Independent Auto Dealers Association and the South Jersey Real Estate 
                Investors Association reinforce his focus on supporting local entrepreneurs and creating job opportunities.
                <br>
                <br>
                At a recent Republican breakfast, Konawel addressed rising electricity bills across New Jersey, attributing the increases to Democratic policies enacted through the New 
                Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU)—a position aligned with the NJ Senate GOP and Senator Mike Testa. He also cited concerns about increasing crime rates statewide 
                and the need for stronger public safety measures.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, Konawel referenced the recent arrest of Newark Mayor and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ras J. Baraka during an incident involving an ICE detention 
                facility. He criticized not only Baraka’s actions but also the public support expressed by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Sweeney. These comments suggest 
                Konawel's alignment with immigration enforcement and a more conservative approach to law and order.
                <br>
                <br>
                While these statements provide a clearer picture of his values, voters would benefit from a fully detailed legislative platform that outlines Konawel’s intended policy 
                initiatives and priorities if elected to the General Assembly.
