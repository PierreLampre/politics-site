              <p>          

                Chris Konawel is a two-term Gloucester County Commissioner who oversees the Department of Government Services and has built a reputation as a 
                reform-minded public official. A small business owner with experience in the automotive and real estate sectors, he combines 
                private-sector know-how with public service. Konawel made history in 2024 as one of only two Republicans re-elected in Gloucester County 
                over the past three decades.
                <br>
                <br>
                A champion jiu-jitsu competitor and lifelong South Jersey resident, Konawel frames his legislative agenda around making New Jersey affordable 
                again, restoring law and order, protecting parents’ rights in education, ending overdevelopment, and reforming government to serve the 
                people. He has released a detailed priorities list covering property-tax relief, bail reform, energy costs, school funding, veterans’ 
                benefits, election integrity, and South Jersey infrastructure.
                <br>
                <br>
                While previously known mostly through party breakfasts and social-media posts, Konawel now presents a clearer public platform that signals 
                a more active, voter-facing campaign. Continued direct communication with constituents — through public events, interviews, and accessible 
                digital content — would further strengthen transparency and help voters see how he intends to carry his county-level record to the State House.

              <h6 class="page-title">Chris Konawell</h6>
              <p>          
                Chris Konawel, a Republican candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly in Legislative District 3, has taken noticeable steps since our earlier 
                review to become more transparent and accessible. He and his running mate, Lawrence Moore, recently sent over their campaign website, 
                which provides a clear list of priorities and a baseline of structured information that had previously been missing. This marks a 
                significant improvement from relying solely on scattered Facebook updates.
                <br>
                <br>
                At a recent meet-and-greet event, Konawel also spoke briefly about the priorities of the small overlap between Gloucester and Cumberland 
                Counties in LD-3. He highlighted constituents’ concerns about not being forced into one-size-fits-all affordable housing mandates, the need 
                for increased police resources in certain townships, and the disproportionate impact of New Jersey’s broken school funding formula on the area. 
                These public comments are a positive sign of issue-specific engagement and a willingness to address local priorities.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is also worth noting that some of the campaign’s outreach and media decisions reflect broader strategy choices. 
                Such strategies can have pros and cons when it comes to press access and voter transparency, and it remains to be seen 
                how this approach develops as the election season unfolds. This also should be seen as common campaign strategy, so it should not 
                be taken as a personal swipe at their campaign, just noted as part of campaign patterns.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although Konawel has not yet participated in a voter-facing interview or responded directly to InformTheVoteNJ outreach, his improved digital 
                presence and willingness to speak about constituent priorities in public settings represent a meaningful step up from his earlier 
                “low-to-below-average” standing. Continued direct communication — especially participating in structured interviews and making his campaign 
                schedule more public — would push him toward a solid “above average” rating heading into the general election.

                    <p>
                    Konawel emphasizes lowering the overall cost of living so seniors, working families, and small businesses can stay and thrive in New Jersey.
                    His plan focuses on capping property taxes, expanding relief for homeowners, cutting wasteful spending in Trenton, and lowering income and business
                    taxes to keep jobs local. He also supports tax-deductible student loan interest and incentives for graduates who choose to live and work in the state.

                    Konawel prioritizes public safety and first responder support. He proposes repealing “Sanctuary State” policies, fixing bail reform laws so violent
                    offenders are held accountable, and restoring protections like qualified immunity so officers can do their jobs effectively. He also wants to reduce
                    administrative burdens so police spend more time fighting crime, not paperwork, and restore COLA pensions for police and fire personnel.

                    Konawel supports a “Parents’ Bill of Rights” to ensure curriculum transparency, age-appropriate lessons, and limit political agendas in classrooms.
                    He calls for fixing the broken school funding formula so South Jersey gets its fair share, expanding vocational training and career pipelines, and
                    supporting school choice so families have real options.

                    Konawel seeks to end Phil Murphy’s Energy Master Plan and reform the Board of Public Utilities to break up monopoly control and lower utility costs.
                    He opposes offshore wind farms that threaten the shore and raise rates, and instead supports an all-of-the-above energy plan — natural gas, nuclear,
                    and renewables — to provide affordable and reliable electricity.

                    Konawel opposes state mandates that force high-density housing into towns without adequate schools, jobs, or infrastructure. He supports protecting
                    open space and farmland from overdevelopment and requiring developers — not taxpayers — to pay for infrastructure upgrades.

                    protecting farmland preservation while maintaining collateral value for farmers, and supporting NJ-grown products to keep agriculture strong.

                    Konawel wants to get state employees back in the office, create a Department of Government Efficiency to expose fraud and abuse, and require
                    transparency on major spending bills by mandating a two-week public review before votes. His “Customer First Initiative” aims to make state agencies
                    responsive and respectful to residents.

                    supporting free-market health options to lower costs, protecting Social Security and Medicare for seniors, and expanding mental health
                    and telehealth access, especially for working families.

                    managing the fishing industry scientifically rather than politically, and restoring wildlife management like the bear hunt guided by experts.

                    At a recent meet-and-greet, Konawel addressed concerns from the portion of LD-3 spanning Gloucester and Cumberland Counties. 
                    He noted strong local opposition to state-mandated high-density housing, a call for more police resources in under-served townships, 
                    and the outsized burden of New Jersey’s broken school funding formula on this area. These comments signal a willingness to speak directly 
                    to district-specific needs rather than applying one-size-fits-all policies.

                Chris Konawel is a Gloucester County Commissioner who oversees the Department of Government Services — including the Construction Board of 
                Appeals, Medical Examiner, Surrogate Court, and County Clerk — and has built a reputation as a reform-minded public official. First elected 
                in 2020 and re-elected in 2024, he is one of just two Republicans to win re-election in Gloucester County over the past three decades.

                An entrepreneur and small-business owner, Konawel has created jobs and managed multimillion-dollar growth in his ventures. He is active in 
                organizations such as the New Jersey Independent Auto Dealers Association, the MidAtlantic Region Independent Auto Dealers Association, 
                the National Independent Auto Dealers Association, and the South Jersey Real Estate Investors Association.

                A resident of Glassboro, Konawel is also a champion jiu-jitsu competitor, having won titles in IBJJF and NAGA events. He highlights the 
                same discipline and determination on the mat in his public service, where he has focused on fighting corruption, holding the line on 
                spending, and reducing taxes for four straight years. Konawel now seeks to bring his emphasis on safer communities, lower taxes, and 
                transparent government from the County Courthouse to the State House.
