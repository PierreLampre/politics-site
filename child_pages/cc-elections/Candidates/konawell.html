              <p>          

                Chris Konawel is a Gloucester County Commissioner currently serving his first term, where he oversees the Department of Government Services. As a small business owner, 
                he emphasizes job creation, economic growth, and limited government, drawing on his experience in the private sector and his involvement in automotive and real estate 
                associations. He also supports Second Amendment rights.
                <br>
                <br>
                While Konawel has not released a formal platform or maintained an active campaign website, he has made public statements during local Republican events. There, he 
                criticized rising electricity costs—blaming Democratic energy policies pushed through the NJ Board of Public Utilities—and raised concerns about increasing crime in the 
                state. He also spoke critically about Democratic gubernatorial candidates Ras J. Baraka and Steve Sweeney following a recent ICE-related incident, signaling a firm stance 
                on immigration enforcement. However, the campaign still lacks consistent digital outreach, event promotion, and direct responses to voter inquiries.

              <h6 class="page-title">Chris Konawell</h6>
              <p>          
                Chris Konawel, a Republican candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly in Legislative District 3, currently lacks a dedicated campaign website. His primary online presence is a 
                Facebook page with limited information about his platform or public appearances. Efforts to engage with him through this channel have been unsuccessful—our message was left “on read” 
                without a reply.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, Konawel has made at least one public appearance during the campaign cycle, speaking briefly at a Republican breakfast event. While the speech was limited in scope, this 
                effort to address voters directly does place him ahead of candidates who have made no public remarks at all. During that same event, he was approached by InformTheVoteNJ.com and 
                asked if he would like to participate in our voter information process. He acknowledged the request but stated that such decisions are run through his campaign manager, offering 
                no commitment or follow-up since.
                <br>
                <br>
                This confirms that Konawel is aware of the outreach and the opportunity to participate. Despite this, he has not taken steps to provide detailed platform information, respond to 
                public inquiries, or participate in structured transparency efforts such as interviews, issue surveys, or forums.
                <br>
                <br>
                Note: While this remains the primary election phase, all four candidates in LD-3 (two Democrats, two Republicans) are running unopposed and are expected to advance to the general 
                election. This creates a valuable opportunity for candidates to begin clearly communicating their platforms early, giving voters more time to learn and engage. We continue to 
                encourage all candidates to take advantage of this head start.
                <br>
                <br>
                Given his limited online engagement but partial public visibility, Konawel currently receives a low-to-below-average rating for transparency and accessibility.

                Chris Konawel has not published a formal campaign platform for his current bid for the General Assembly in Legislative District 3. However, his public remarks and past 
                service offer insight into his legislative priorities. As a Gloucester County Commissioner and small business owner, Konawel has consistently emphasized economic growth, 
                efficient government, and a business-friendly climate. His affiliations with the New Jersey Independent Auto Dealers Association and the South Jersey Real Estate 
                Investors Association reinforce his focus on supporting local entrepreneurs and creating job opportunities.

                <br>
                At a recent Republican breakfast, Konawel addressed rising electricity bills across New Jersey, attributing the increases to Democratic policies enacted through the New 
                Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU)—a position aligned with the NJ Senate GOP and Senator Mike Testa. He also cited concerns about increasing crime rates statewide 
                and the need for stronger public safety measures.

                <br>
                Additionally, Konawel referenced the recent arrest of Newark Mayor and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ras J. Baraka during an incident involving an ICE detention 
                facility. He criticized not only Baraka’s actions but also the public support expressed by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Sweeney. These comments suggest 
                Konawel's alignment with immigration enforcement and a more conservative approach to law and order.
                <br>
                <br>
                While these statements provide a clearer picture of his values, voters would benefit from a fully detailed legislative platform that outlines Konawel’s intended policy 
                initiatives and priorities if elected to the General Assembly.
