    <h4 class="quick-sum">quick summary</h4>
    <h6 class="page-title">Richard Kott</h6>
    <p>
      Richard “Rick” Kott is a lifelong Millville resident, Marine Corps veteran (Sergeant; Desert Storm), and a 25-year Millville Police Department 
      veteran whose work spanned patrol, the juvenile unit, school resource officer duties, and robust community-policing programs (PAL, NFL Play 60, 
      Explorers, youth outreach). His candidacy centers on changing City Hall’s culture toward accountability and responsiveness, strengthening public 
      safety and police visibility, and rebuilding trust with residents.
      <br><br>
      Kott’s platform emphasizes practical basics with long-horizon planning: make the city’s website a functional hub; publish schedules 
      (leaf/brush pickup, events, service updates); improve PR to attract residents and businesses; modernize IT; and move from “band-aids” to sustainable
       plans for roads, water, and sewer. He proposes clear 6-month, 1-year, 4-year, and 10-year plans so voters can measure progress.
      <br><br>
      On public safety, he wants to lift staffing and restore visible, proactive policing and community engagement, noting that visibility builds safety 
      and cooperation. He also prioritizes listening to employees and residents—“people can accept an answer they don’t like; they won’t accept no answer 
      at all”—and he intends to publish educational interviews with commissioners, department heads, and candidates so the public understands roles, 
      responsibilities, and issues.

    <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
    <h6 class="page-title">Richard Kott</h6>
    <p>
      Initial transparency/accessibility view: <em>Developing (trending upward)</em>. Kott has a substantive, unedited platform video outlining priorities 
      and a campaign Facebook page (listed below). At this stage, we have not yet logged a dedicated campaign website, long-form 
      interviews, or a truly public facing campaign event. What that means is that there is an upcoming event with Kott and two other candidates that is 
      technically a fundraiser, which limits voters and the press from hearing campaign messaging without directly supporting it. It also raises the question 
      of whether these 3 candidates are campaigning together without publicly saying so.
      <br><br>
      What would move this rating up: a central campaign site with organized agenda/issue pages; coordinated communication with the press; long-form 
      interviews (radio/podcast/video); a truly public and advertised campaign event; and timely replies to voter/media inquiries. As those pieces appear, 
      we’ll update the rating to reflect real-world 
      accessibility for voters. The main benefit for voters with this candidate and many others is to engage in the action plans that describe how his 
      campaign ideas will actually materialize if they get elected.

    <h4 class="sub-heading">Background and Campaign Message</h4>
    <div class="experience can-sec">
        <p><em>— Source: Candidate campaign video and notes</em></p>
      <p>
        Richard “Rick” Kott is a lifelong Millville resident who graduated from Millville Senior High School (Class of 1988). He enlisted in the United 
        States Marine Corps four days after graduation and served as a Sergeant during Desert Storm. After returning home, he joined the Millville Police 
        Department in 1999 and served for 25 years, retiring in 2023–2024. Much of his work focused on youth and community-policing: school resource officer, 
        juvenile unit, PAL programs, NFL Play 60, Explorers, and chaplain partnership initiatives that kept young people on track.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kott says he’s running to change the culture of local government from “it’s always been that way” to accountability and responsiveness. He argues 
        residents should always get a returned call and a straight answer—even when the answer isn’t what they hoped to hear. His priorities include 
        rebuilding public safety staffing and visibility, improving city PR and the website, modernizing IT, and replacing short-term fixes with sustainable 
        long-term plans for roads, water, and sewer.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also plans to publish educational interviews with city leaders and fellow candidates so voters can see who handles which responsibilities, 
        what the current challenges are, and how to measure progress over time.
