              <p>          

                Michael Rothman is the current Mayor of Downe Township and is seeking reelection in the 2025 primary alongside running mate Larry Jordan. Rothman has previously been 
                involved in major local infrastructure projects, such as the Fortescue and Gandyâ€™s Beach Sewer Project, and is listed on the official township website. He has received 
                public support in past elections from the Cumberland County Regular Republican Organization, though recent reports suggest his relationship with county leadership may 
                now be strained.
                <br>
                <br>
                Rothman has not maintained a campaign website or active social media presence, and he has not engaged in direct voter outreach this election cycle. Efforts to obtain 
                updated campaign information from his ticket have gone unanswered.
                <br>
                <br>
                Complicating his reelection bid is a growing controversy surrounding Downe Townshipâ€™s decision to pay a settlement to Rothmanâ€™s stepson, Nicholas Haines, following a 
                2024 vehicle accident. The use of taxpayer funds in this case â€” and the potential conflict of interest â€” has triggered public demands for transparency and 
                accountability, especially as new, unverified allegations surface about the circumstances of the crash. Township officials have not issued a public statement 
                clarifying the matter, and key questions remain unanswered.

              <h6 class="page-title">Michael Rothman</h6>
              <p>          

                Michael Rothman is the current Mayor of Downe Township and a sitting member of the Township Committee. He is seeking re-election and has been endorsed in the past by 
                the Cumberland County Regular Republican Organization. Rothmanâ€™s governmental role is publicly documented through the townshipâ€™s website, where he is listed as a point 
                of contact and noted for his involvement in infrastructure projects such as the Fortescue and Gandyâ€™s Beach Sewer Project.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, Rothman has not maintained a public campaign presence for the 2025 election. There is no campaign website, no social media activity, and no known public 
                events, interviews, or outreach efforts that would inform voters about his intentions for a new term. Despite an attempt to obtain updated campaign information 
                through his running mate, no response was received.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition, Rothman is now at the center of a growing controversy involving a taxpayer-funded settlement paid to his stepson after a 2024 vehicle accident. The lack 
                of a public statement or detailed explanation from Rothman or township officials has only increased concerns about transparency, accountability, and potential conflicts 
                of interestâ€”especially as unverified allegations surrounding the incident continue to circulate.
                <br>
                <br>
                Endorsements and incumbency may provide a baseline for name recognition, but they are not substitutes for open, responsive communication with the publicâ€”particularly 
                in a climate of controversy. In light of his limited engagement and unresolved public concerns, Michael Rothman receives a low rating for transparency and accessibility 
                in the 2025 election cycle.
