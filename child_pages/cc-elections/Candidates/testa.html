            </div>
            <h4 class="sub-heading">Candidates Forum Statements</h4>
            <div class="experience">
                At the Candidates Forum held at Bridgeton High School, Testa said he would be the most qualified for his position 
                because he has experience, he helped the county get back on its feet during and after the pandemic, he has helped 
                the county's unemployment problem, and he has helped with rental assistance. Inform the Vote would also like to add that 
                his challenger continues to appear to have 'ghosted' the campaign, with almost no public knowledge available about him.
                <br>
                <br>
                When asked about handling the state's deficit and achieving fiscal responsibility, Testa spoke about the state having 
                a 10 billion dollar surplus, which should have gone back to the taxpayers. He was against the 200 million dollar French 
                museum, that he would rather have seen that money go to investing in parks and other activities for the youth. He also 
                mentioned supporting the black heritage trail and the Harriet Tubman Museum. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When asked about handling gun violence, Testa spoke about taking the handcuffs off of police officers (let them do their 
                jobs), guns coming from a known illegal route from the eastern shores of Virginia, and made it clear that he was against 
                illegal gun ownership.
                <br>
                <br>
                When the issue of school safety was brought up, Testa again referenced the 200 million dollar French Museum project that 
                was approved while 400 thousand dollars was not spent at Weymouth School to provide a needed vestibule, which would have 
                been used as a buffered security zone.
