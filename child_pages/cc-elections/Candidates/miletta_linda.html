        <h6 class="page-title">Linda Miletta</h6>
        <p>
        Linda Miletta is seeking re-election to the Lawrence Township Board of Education. A 25-year public-school teacher,
        EMS Captain/EMT, and active community volunteer, she frames her candidacy around student achievement, responsible
        budgeting, effective operations, and stronger school–community ties.
        <br><br>
        Miletta’s background includes service with Lawrence Twp. EMS (Captain/EMT), the Lawrence Twp. Parade &amp; Events Committee,
        the Myron L. Powell Early Childhood Advisory Committee, and Lawrence Twp. Recreation. As a longtime township resident and
        parent of a recent district graduate, she emphasizes safe, inclusive, and academically rigorous schools.
        <br><br>
        Her agenda is presented as governance goals rather than issue-by-issue positions: representing community interests,
        supporting student outcomes, ensuring fiscal stewardship, shaping policy and curriculum, improving operational efficiency,
        providing leadership, and engaging the public. Specific stances on current controversies or priorities were not provided.

        <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
        <h6 class="page-title">Linda Miletta</h6>
        <p>
        Relative to the Cumberland County status quo, Miletta’s response is <strong>slightly above average</strong>: she replied promptly
        with a courteous, comprehensive cover letter that outlines her background and broad goals. That’s more than many candidates
        provide.
        <br><br>
        However, the content remains <em>surface-level</em>. There are no specific positions on current district issues, no examples of
        recent board decisions, no measurable targets, and no long-form interview or Q&amp;A to give voters deeper context. It’s enough
        to signal competence and community service—and may be enough to win re-election—but it leaves an opening: if an opponent
        supplies detailed, on-the-record stances (or participates in a substantive interview), voters may perceive that as stronger
        transparency and preparedness.
        <br><br>
        As always, the goal here is not to micromanage campaigns but to reduce the scavenger hunt for voters. A brief, structured
        follow-up (issue list, recent votes or initiatives, and a 30–60 minute interview) would quickly move this toward a higher tier.

        <p><strong>Dear Community Members,</strong></p>

        <p>
            My name is Linda Miletta, and I am excited to announce my candidacy for re-election for Lawrence Township School Board. 
            As a lifelong educator, active community volunteer, dedicated parent, and proud township resident, I believe I bring a 
            unique and balanced perspective to the challenges and opportunities facing our schools.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the past 25 years, I have served as a public-school teacher, working directly with students, families, and colleagues 
            to foster meaningful learning and academic growth. I understand the day-to-day realities of our classrooms—what our students 
            need to succeed, what our teachers need to thrive, and how policy decisions affect both. I am passionate about public education 
            and I can contribute to an environment where all students can thrive.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am also a mother to a school-aged child whom is a recent graduate of our district. I know firsthand what it means to entrust 
            our schools with the care and education of our children. Like you, I want to ensure our schools are safe, inclusive, and 
            academically rigorous.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond the classroom and home, I actively volunteer in our community and proudly support local initiatives. I am a Lifetime Member 
            and Captain/EMT of Lawrence Twp. EMS, an active member of the Lawrence Twp. Parade &amp; Events Committee, the Myron L. Powell Early 
            Childhood Advisory Committee, and Lawrence Twp. Recreation. I am also a township taxpayer who believes in fiscal responsibility and 
            maximizing the value of every dollar spent in our district. My husband, an active member of our community as well, also shares my 
            commitment to public service and civic engagement.
        </p>

        <p><strong>If re-elected, I will strive to:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Represent the community’s interests in educational matters</li>
            <li>Positively impact student achievement</li>
            <li>Ensure responsible financial stewardship</li>
            <li>Shape educational policy and curriculum</li>
            <li>Ensure efficient and effective school operations</li>
            <li>Provide leadership and direction</li>
            <li>Engage with the community and strengthen school–community ties</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I would be honored to earn your trust and your vote. Together, we can continue building a school district that reflects the strengths, 
            values, and hopes of our entire community. We’re in this together!
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
            With gratitude,<br>
            <strong>Linda Miletta</strong><br>
            Candidate for Lawrence Twp. School Board
