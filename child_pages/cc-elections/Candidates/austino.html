              <h6 class="page-title">Robert A. Austino</h6>
              <p>Former Sheriff Austino is a democrat who appears to be running with former commissioner Capizola 
              'against' candidates Smith and Perella. The sheriff has lengthy experience working in government as sheriff, but no direct experience as a 
              commissioner. As per a campaign picture on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122116637984284447&set=a.122109417842284447">facebook campaign site</a>, his agenda 
              seems to be to improve road/infrastructure/broadband, support senior housing and healthcare, and provide recreational advancements. 
              </p>
              <p>              
                Also, Inform the Vote has not yet received a
              response from him regarding campaign related information. A surface level guess would be that Austino and Capizola would be more center-left 
              than Perella and Smith, but we cannot verify that at the moment. Click the red x at the top of this box and then scroll down down for more in-depth

                As of 8/1/2024, Inform the Vote has scoured the internet and attempted to contact the former Sheriff multiple times. In regards to his specific agenda, there only seems 
                to be a campaign picture on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122116637984284447&set=a.122109417842284447">facebook campaign site</a>, which states he plans

                After reaching out to various members of the CumberlandNJ Dems, it is unclear how the Democrat party agenda specifically and currently applies to Cumberland County. However, 
                we might be able to infer the following things from last year's messaging:
                <ul>
                    <li>Support Senior housing and Healthcare Services.</li>
                    <li>Provide county recreational advancements, building a county indoor sports facility and swim center and improving county recreation areas.</li>
                    <li>Support state of the art correctional facility, by improving conditions and programs and drive long standing issues with facility to closure. Also wishes to reduce 
                        cost and tax burden of facility.</li>

                <br>
                <br>

                <h5>Summary</h5>

                <br>
                <p>The former Sheriff and Jim Quinn spent approximately the first 30 minutes talking about the Sheriffs prior experience as a Sheriff and 
                    reminiscing about local politics. Of note, they mentioned that the former Sheriff helped get accreditation to the Sheriff's office, which
                    helped put formal, state recognized policies in place and maintain modern standards through the years. Quinn used to be a mayor and freeholder,
                    so he was able to offer kind words about how helpful the former Sheriff was throughout the years. 
                    <br>
                    They spent some time defining what the role of the Sheriff's office is, which seems to be broken down into 3 categories:
                    <br>
                        1. Protecting the courthouses
                    <br>
                        2. Serving warrants
                    <br>
                        3. Communications division
                        <br>

                        All in all, there wasn't much directly related to making a choice in the democrat primary for county commissioner.
