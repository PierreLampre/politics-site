              <h6 class="page-title">Robert A. Austino</h6>
              <p>Austino has lengthy experience working in government as sheriff, but no direct experience as a commissioner. As per a few campaign pictures on his 
              facebook campaign site, 
              <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122116637984284447&set=a.122109417842284447">here</a> and 
              <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamrileyaustinocapizola/posts/pfbid02kXpgWN6AFFLfGwmBpbnxvUHsBi7hGUvGDJoA8LLgh8qaFWtfuroJHpU5rkBZcNp4l">here</a>, 
              his agenda seems to be to improve roads/infrastructure/broadband, support senior housing and healthcare, provide recreational advancements, enhance 
              resources for enforcement and emergency services, and promote local businesses and job creation.
              Additionally, on August 13th 
              he posted on facebook with details saying he will promote economic growth, public safety, and infrastructure improvement.
              </p>
              <p>              
            When asked at Deerfield Day to clarify his agenda, policy positions, and to compare that to the incumbents he is challenging, Austino basically said (paraphrased): 
            "My big thing is money and budget. The county is attempting to build 3 county parks when our budget is stretched. I helped run a budget for 15 years, so I will help bring 
            fiscal responsibility to the board of commissioners." However, when we checked with Commissioner Romero about this, he replied (paraphrased) "The county park projects are 
            within budget, there's nothing to be concerned about." Be sure to check our 
            <a href="https://www.informthevotenj.com/child_pages/cc-elections/cc_election_issues">county issues page</a> to get a more detailed look at what's going on in the county. 
            Also, Austino and Capizola have openly supported the Harris/Walz 
            ticket on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamrileyaustinocapizola/posts/pfbid02TfP87cUqFVnRcghD2B2azdWREc7QMw6twNeWtgZYQ1obVZwmXvrB2McQgDrfFEHxl?rdid=kpuRhdj1uAT0qrfm">facebook</a>, 
            so it follows that Austino/Capizola will support and/or implement that agenda, unless they clarify otherwise in the future. You can also listen 
            to a radio show which he, Capizola, and Riley did 
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamrileyaustinocapizola/posts/pfbid0V9gEGpVBMcGEsMc7PVNr6qxvzrLCy1Zf7b3rvpubUJpRhqtn8h538fZfrzhiPnn2l?rdid=9H2emx8RQXDRCyA3">here</a>.

                    To be clear, with the lack of a proper newspaper providing thorough, professional-level election coverage, both sides of the aisle in *local* 
                politics seem to be suffering from a lack of clear messaging. This is not to say that they aren't putting forward a lot of effort to message, 
                but the information is oftentimes scattered across the internet, spoken about at meetings/events that appear partisan or have expensive 
                sponsorship fees, or mentioned at lengthy meetings most people simply won't attend. Oftentimes people get brief literature like

                . They also might get vague impressions of what local Republicans or Democrats might believe based on what they know about national politics. While 
                we have been able to gain some information regarding his agenda, there is probably a lot more detail that we could go 
                into about the specifics of the Commissioner's board and Austino's campaign bid.

                As of 9/29/2024, Inform the Vote has scoured the internet and attempted to contact the former Sheriff multiple times. There doesn't seem to be any available information in 
                regards to his specific policy positions, other than he is against what he claims is the county over-spending on county park projects... however, we cross-checked 
                this with Commissioner Romero who says the parks are within budget and there is no need for concern.

                <br>
                <br>

                <h5>Summary</h5>

                <br>
                <p>The former Sheriff and Jim Quinn spent approximately the first 30 minutes talking about the Sheriffs prior experience as a Sheriff and 
                    reminiscing about local politics. Of note, they mentioned that the former Sheriff helped get accreditation to the Sheriff's office, which
                    helped put formal, state recognized policies in place and maintain modern standards through the years. Quinn used to be a mayor and freeholder,
                    so he was able to offer kind words about how helpful the former Sheriff was throughout the years. 
                    <br>
                    They spent some time defining what the role of the Sheriff's office is, which seems to be broken down into 3 categories:
                    <br>
                        1. Protecting the courthouses
                    <br>
                        2. Serving warrants
                    <br>
                        3. Communications division
                        <br>

                        All in all, there wasn't much directly related to making a choice in the democrat primary for county commissioner.
