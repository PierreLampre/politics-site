              <p>The quick summary for Candidate Austino: Former Sheriff Austino is a democrat who appears to be running with former commissioner Capizola 
              'against' candidates Smith and Perella. The sheriff has lengthy experience working in government as sheriff, but no direct experience as a 
              commissioner. There seems to be no easily accessible information regarding his platform or agenda, and Inform the Vote has not yet received a
              response from him regarding campaign related information. A surface level guess would be that Austino and Capizola would be more center-left 
              than Perella and Smith, but we cannot verify that at the moment. Scroll down for more in-depth information and sources.

                <br>
                <br>

                <h5>Summary</h5>

                <br>
                <p>The former Sheriff and Jim Quinn spent approximately the first 30 minutes talking about the Sheriffs prior experience as a Sheriff and 
                    reminiscing about local politics. Of note, they mentioned that the former Sheriff helped get accreditation to the Sheriff's office, which
                    helped put formal, state recognized policies in place and maintain modern standards through the years. Quinn used to be a mayor and freeholder,
                    so he was able to offer kind words about how helpful the former Sheriff was throughout the years. 
                    <br>
                    They spent some time defining what the role of the Sheriff's office is, which seems to be broken down into 3 categories:
                    <br>
                        1. Protecting the courthouses
                    <br>
                        2. Serving warrants
                    <br>
                        3. Communications division
                        <br>

                        All in all, there wasn't much directly related to making a choice in the democrat primary for county commissioner.
