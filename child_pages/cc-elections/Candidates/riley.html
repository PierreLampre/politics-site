              <p>Current County Clerk Celeste Riley is running for re-election this year. She is currently serving her second term, which means she inherently has more 
                experience in this position than her Republican challenger, Commissioner Lods. She was an Assemblywoman in the 3rd district, having won re-election for 
                that position, and served several committee positions during her tenure in that position. She has served as both a Bridgeton City Council member and the 
                Bridgeton City Council president. A facebook post on August 13th states that her agenda will include streamlining county services, implementing transparency 
                and accountability, and implementing community engagement. We have reached out to her for clarifications on overall agenda, policy, and comparisons to her challenger, 
                but we are still working out whether she will provide information directly to us for concerns regarding potential partisanship on our part. During the process of 
                trying to contact candidates for election related information, we reached out to her offices several times and were able to get useful contact information. As of now 
                9/1/2024, there have been some issues regarding the Clerk's office regarding things such as the

                is being presented to the public. You can also view what looks like a video of her and John Capizola

                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wvltradio/videos/849795337255055">here</a>, but we haven't had time to review them yet. It also seems as though they 
                have been posting more regular information in their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamrileyaustinocapizola/">faebook group</a>, so be sure to follow 
                that if you'd like to stay current. Similarly, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/442220931182672">Cumberland NJ Dems</a> have been regularly 
                posting as well.

                After reaching out to various members of the CumberlandNJ Dems, it is unclear how the Democrat party agenda specifically and currently applies to Cumberland County. However, 
                we might be able to infer the following things from last year's messaging:
                <ul>
                    <li>Support Senior housing and Healthcare Services.</li>
                    <li>Provide county recreational advancements, building a county indoor sports facility and swim center and improving county recreation areas.</li>
                    <li>Support state of the art correctional facility, by improving conditions and programs and drive long standing issues with facility to closure. Also wishes to reduce 
                        cost and tax burden of facility.</li>

                After reaching out to Riley and receiving no response, it is unclear how any policy positions she may have relates to the office of County Clerk other than she 
                might be more inclined to push for Democrat policies and agendas in a Republican dominated county.
