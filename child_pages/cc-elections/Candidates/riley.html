              <h6 class="page-title">Celeste Riley</h6>
              <p>
                Current County Clerk Celeste Riley is running for re-election this year. She is currently serving her second term, which means she inherently has more 
                experience in this position than her Republican challenger, Commissioner Lods. She was an Assemblywoman in the 3rd district, having won re-election for 
                that position, and served several committee positions during her tenure in that position. She has served as both a Bridgeton City Council member and the 
                Bridgeton City Council president. Like many candidates, Celeste does seem like a strong general political candidate, but it is not clear how her qualifications 
                and prior agendas directly relate to the role of County Clerk, other than she is on her 2nd term. This makes it difficult to fully assess specific choices 
                on the ballot, especially when comparing her to another candidate, a Commissioner with lots of political experience, who might be equally or better qualified, 
                or who might have a preferable current agenda. We have reached out to her for clarifications and comparisons via official government email, but have not 
                received a response. Click the x at the top red of this box to go back to the page.

                As of 8/1/2024, we have scoured the internet and attempted to contact Riley multiple times with no response. It is unclear what her current agenda is, but we might infer the

            <h4 class="sub-heading">party messaging</h4>
            <div class="agenda-per-party-site">
                After reaching out to various members of the CumberlandNJ Dems, it is unclear how the Democrat party agenda specifically and currently applies to Cumberland County. However, 
                we might be able to infer the following things from last year's messaging:
                <ul>
                    <li>Support Senior housing and Healthcare Services.</li>
                    <li>Provide county recreational advancements, building a county indoor sports facility and swim center and improving county recreation areas.</li>
                    <li>Support state of the art correctional facility, by improving conditions and programs and drive long standing issues with facility to closure. Also wishes to reduce 
                        cost and tax burden of facility.</li>
                </ul> 
            </div>                
            
            <h4 class="sub-heading">policy positions</h4>
            <div class="policy-positions">
                After reaching out to Riley and receiving no response, it is unclear how any policy positions she may have relates to the office of County Clerk other than she 
                might be more inclined to push for Democrat policies and agendas in a Republican dominated county.
