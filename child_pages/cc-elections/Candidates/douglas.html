              <h6 class="page-title">Makema Douglas</h6>
              Makema Douglas is a lifelong Vineland resident, graduate of Vineland High School, and the only current candidate who has taught in Vineland 
              Public Schools. She also holds certifications in education, leadership, supervision, and administration, and has served as a youth pastor, 
              community program developer, author, and entrepreneur.
              <br>
              Her agenda focuses on clear, timely communication between administration, parents, and students—especially on academic performance, schedules, 
              transportation, and graduation readiness—as well as ensuring all departments follow updated policies and standards.
              <br>
              Douglas sees the school board as a non-partisan body and supports high expectations paired with targeted supports and a full range of 
              extracurricular activities. While personally aligned with many Democratic views, she emphasizes finding common ground to keep the focus on 
              student success.

              <h6 class="page-title">Makema Douglas</h6>
              <p>          

                Makema Douglas has gone beyond the baseline by responding to our candidate questionnaire and participating in a brief “man-on-the-street” 
                style interview. Those steps show she’s open to sharing her perspective and willing to engage directly with voters.
                <br>
                To push this rating higher, she would need to take the next step by participating in one or more longer-form interviews where she can unpack 
                her platform in depth, address district-specific concerns, and give voters a clearer picture of her plans. Hosting or attending planned 
                meet-and-greet events where residents can ask questions directly would also demonstrate proactive outreach and strengthen her transparency 
                and accessibility profile.
                <br>
                Overall, she’s on a positive trajectory—her existing efforts already place her a bit above the local status quo, and a few targeted moves 
                could quickly elevate her into the top tier of candidate openness.

      <blockquote style="margin:0;">
        <p><strong>Overall agenda:</strong> My focus is to address the current school environment as it relates to parent notification about anything impacting their child's school experience, academic performance changes and schedule, transportation grade level promotion and graduation readiness. These issues are concerning for most taxpayers, School faculty, parents and even students. There are changes that are expected to occur within the Department of Education. Most of the changes have yet to unfold and many people are concerned with how it will impact their school experience, funding, and job security.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I plan to accomplish these things by addressing administration to keep transparency in communication throughout channels and to work together so that all departments are following updates, regulations, policies, standards, and best practices.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Issue Positions:</strong> I believe the issues arise because we haven't used simple approaches to finding solutions for issues. I believe that politics have played too much a part of a non-partisan system. It is important that we keep the issues, goals and main focus about educating our students and providing them with access to a quality education that has high academic expectations, accommodations to support those students that are struggling to reach the goals and outcomes put in place, to provide supportive and extracurricular activities, such as sports, clubs, theater, arts community work, and collaborations. These factors should be present to ensure that each student will receive a holistic approach to education, in ways that best suits their ability to learn because one size does not fit all.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Party Affiliation:</strong> I believe the school board should remain non-partisan entity. However, I am aligned with most Democratic views. Nevertheless, if we must deal with people and their ideology , theology, or psychology we should agree to agree and agree to disagree. I believe there's an amicable way to approach every situation and that we should be able to find common ground. We must in order to do the best in providing our students with optimum opportunities for success in the school system.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Upcoming Campaign:</strong> I would love to be invited to more events, radio shows, and podcasts. I currently have a few interviews posted online. You can continue to look for me at more local community events and social media platforms.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Distinguishing Yourself from Opponents:</strong> My background distinguishes me from my opponents. I am a product of Vineland Public schools K through 12. I am the only running mate and potential person on the board that has taught in Vineland Public Schools. My certifications are in education, leadership, supervision, and administration in education.  My children attended and graduated from Vineland public schools and are productive citizens. I am a vested community activist, former youth pastor, community program developer, author and entrepreneur currently, Also, I nor my husband is employed by the city or has a contract with the city or its schools. I also do not hold a paying position for the county. My sole goal is to serve this community and its residence starting from the youngest to the eldest. I have no other agenda, and this is a volunteer position.</p>
