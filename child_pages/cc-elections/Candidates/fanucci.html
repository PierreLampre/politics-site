              <h6 class="page-title">Anthony Fanucci</h6>
                Mayor Fanucci has been mayor for the past seven years and was actually the first significant contact we were able to make to open the 
                door into local politics. He has been very communicative with us and you can see his detailed election related information below. He plans 
                to make many investments including restoration projects, preparing new sites for the industrial park, and new entertainment sites. He recognizes 
                the city has some common, ongoing issues such as needing job creation, public safety, and infrastructure improvements, but that he also already 
                has a team in place that will continue to work to improve these areas in a fiscally responsible way. And when comparing himself to his opponent, 
                he believes his opponent represents the old ways of thinking, and now is the time to continue to improve the city by sticking to the current plans.

                Quoted directly from communication with the mayor:
                <br>
                <br>
                To remain focused on five key long-term priorities:  fiscal responsibility, economic development, support for public safety, 
                infrastructure investments, and environmental stewardship.   
                <br>
                <br>
                As part of our long-term priorities, there are a number of specific plans we will move forward on including the Chestnut Avenue 
                Restoration Project, site preparations for our new Industrial Park West, renovations at the Vineland Senior Center and the Carl Arthur 
                Recreation Center, a new Vineland Event Center, and restoration of the historic Vineland Municipal Utilities Sign which will once again 
                light up the night sky.

                <br>
                <br>
                I would say much like most city's fiscal responsibility, business attraction/retention, job creation, infrastructure improvements, 
                and public safety.  I work hard every day on these issues and have assembled an outstanding team to support our policy initiatives.   
                Because of our business environment, we have been able to attract new development and grow the tax base.  We budget like a business so 
                that resources are not wasted, take advantage of all grant opportunities where they exist, and look for ways to work with regional 
                partners to create economies of scale.

                Quoted directly from communication with the mayor:
                <br>
                <br>
                My opponent represents old ways of thinking, and has presented no new ideas.  Now is not the time to return to the past, especially with 
                a candidate who has shown such poor judgement in their recent conduct.

                We must continue to move forward, show leadership, work together, and position Vineland for even greater success in the years to come. 
                We have worked too hard over the past seven plus years to earn our place as a growing community that businesses and families want to 
                invest in.  I ask you to support Team Fanucci on November 5.
