              <h6 class="page-title">Jeff Van Drew</h6>
              <p>
                J.D. Vance is an American best-selling author, current US Senator, and venture capitalist who is the Republican nominee for US Vice President. 

                <br>
                <br>

                Vance's populist and nationalist views align with Trump's ideology, which might make him a suitable running mate.
                Both Vance and Trump have spoken out against the perceived elitism of the political establishment and the negative impact of globalization on American workers.
                Vance's background as a Marine and his experience in the private sector might appeal to Trump's base. Vance, once a critic of Trump, has become a staunch 
                supporter. His alignment with Trump's "America First" policies strengthens their combined appeal to conservative voters. 
                Vance supports Trump's economic and social policies, promising to continue the agenda of reducing government intervention and promoting conservative social values.

                <br>
                <br>

                Vance's economic policies, such as reducing the national debt and promoting American manufacturing, differ from the Biden administration's focus on increasing 
                government spending and investing in social programs. On healthcare, Vance supports repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, whereas the Biden 
                administration has sought to strengthen and expand the program. Vance's stance on immigration and border control is more restrictive than the Biden 
                administration's approach, which has focused on reforming the immigration system and providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
                Vance and Trump focus on deregulation and reducing the size of tech companies, contrasting Biden/Harris's approach of increasing regulation and promoting big 
                government solutions. Vance's conservative stance on issues like abortion contrasts sharply with the more liberal positions of Biden and Harris.
                Vance's less interventionist approach diverges from the Biden administration's more active international engagement.

                    <li>Foreign Policy: Vance promotes a less interventionist approach, criticizing U.S. involvement in Ukraine and calling for European nations to take

                    Vance's political platform focuses on issues like economic development, education, and healthcare in Ohio.
