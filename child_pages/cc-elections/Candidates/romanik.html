              <p>          

                Mayor Ben Romanik emphasizes economic development as the driver for Millville’s future—highlighting projects like the Levoni Meats expansion, the CRP build-out under a long-term 
                PILOT, and cannabis revenue as recurring sources to fund city priorities such as public safety staffing, modern equipment, and infrastructure upgrades. He pairs this with 
                commitments to improving streets and underground utilities, retaining public-safety personnel, and pressing for stronger South Jersey representation at the regional level. 
                Romanik points to tangible accomplishments, including industrial park momentum, pump station upgrades, LED streetlight conversions, and finalized public-safety labor contracts.
                <br>
                <br>
                On governance, he has shifted his stance on the Walsh Act form of government, acknowledging departmental silos and communication gaps while supporting a third-party study to explore 
                alternatives, even if the issue is treated as “back-burner” for now.
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of transparency and accessibility, Romanik earns a rating of “A Bit Above Average.” He is a consistent presence at City Hall, community events, and regional meetings, 
                and he has participated in my meet-n-greet, a full radio interview, and plans to attend the upcoming candidate forum which will be recorded for public viewing. These are meaningful 
                steps. Still, a lack of sufficient advance coordination left 
                his radio interview more improvised than focused, and it remains uncertain whether voters would have seen clearly advertised, campaign-specific, public events without outside 
                involvement from this startup 'press'-related project.

              <h6 class="page-title">Benjamin Romanik</h6>
              <p>          
                Mayor Ben Romanik remains one of the most visibly present figures in Millville public life. He regularly attends City Hall meetings, 
                community events, and civic gatherings—often engaging residents directly before and after sessions. His presence extends beyond city limits 
                to regional meetings and Republican breakfasts, where he is approachable and well-known among colleagues and constituents alike. That level 
                of daily accessibility goes a long way in establishing personal rapport and trust within the community.
                <br>
                <br>
                From a campaign standpoint, Romanik has participated in multiple key voter-access events: he attended the InformTheVoteNJ Meet & Greet, 
                made a brief appearance at the recorded Candidates Forum, and completed a radio interview on WVLT. These actions place him above the local 
                baseline—particularly in a field where several candidates almost declined participation altogether.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, his campaign strategy also reflects a level of informality that leaves some gaps in structured transparency. Romanik was the only 
                major candidate absent from the Four Seasons Forum (reportedly for understandable reasons), and while he may have been present at the Housing 
                Authority event, there’s no clearly documented record of attendance or remarks. More notably, he has no comprehensive campaign website, and 
                coordination ahead of his WVLT interview was minimal—resulting in a conversation that drifted between community storytelling and focused 
                campaign discussion. While it was personable and engaging, it lacked some of the structure that would help voters clearly identify his agenda, 
                plans, and distinctions from other candidates in such a crowded race.
                <br>
                <br>
                The broader question isn’t whether Romanik is accessible—he absolutely is—but how effectively that accessibility translates into clear, 
                public-facing campaign communication. In a smaller race, his “show up and talk to people” approach might suffice. But in a 19-candidate 
                election, and especially as a sitting mayor, there’s an elevated expectation for modeling best practices. The absence of a well-organized 
                campaign infrastructure—website, scheduled public Q&A, consistent press coordination—means that many voters will rely on word-of-mouth 
                rather than durable, shareable information.
                <br>
                <br>
                Romanik ultimately “squeaks a bit above” the status quo on transparency because his community visibility compensates for organizational gaps. 
                But from a strategic and civic example standpoint, that’s a missed opportunity. In a year defined by competitive campaigning and calls for 
                higher transparency standards, the mayor’s campaign didn’t quite set the bar—it met it just enough to stay above average.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall rating: A Bit Above Average (Stable) — high community presence and approachability offset by a lack of structured communication and 
                proactive campaign organization.

                        A structured recap of Steven Solof’s interview with Mayor Ben Romanik, who is seeking re-election. 
                        The conversation focuses on Millville’s Walsh Act government structure and communication breakdowns at City Hall, 
                        then moves into economic development priorities (Levoni, CRP, and PILOTs), design changes on Main Street, 
                        code enforcement philosophies, and staffing/retention challenges in public safety. 
                        Romanik emphasizes seeing through current projects and ensuring Millville is ready for future growth.

                        A conversational QBC segment from the Finish Line Pub at NJ Motorsports Park. 
                        Mayor Ben Romanik and host Jim Quinn range from local business buzz (Union Lake Crossing’s tenant mix, 
                        restaurant scene) to nuts-and-bolts city operations (major fires, equipment delays, leaf/bulk pickup), 
                        and then into policy: shared-services policing within the UEZ, PILOT-backed ratables at the Motorsports Park, 
                        staffing and retention challenges in public safety, and industrial-park growth (RDC’s planned “Veterans Park”). 
                        Through it, Romanik emphasizes practical coordination across agencies and neighboring towns, plus keeping Millville
                        “business-ready” while minding resident services.

                    While previously in favor of the Walsh Act (a form of government that former Mayor Quinn referred to as a system with 5 mini-mayors), he now favors 
                    changing the Walsh Act structure, citing siloed departments and communication gaps. He also notes past failed referenda (ballot votes) on the issue and
                    suggests a third-party study to recommend the best alternative. He also called it a “back-burner” priority for timing, despite supporting
                    change in principle, making it unclear the level of commitment to resolving the issue.
