              <p>          

                Dave Bailey is a first-term Assemblyman representing Legislative District 3, which includes Salem, Gloucester, and Cumberland Counties. Born and raised in Salem County, he serves 
                on the Transportation and Independent Authorities Committee as well as the Telecommunications and Utilities Committee. Bailey is the CEO of Ranch Hope, a faith-based nonprofit 
                serving youth and families, and has spent his professional life advocating for mental health and educational services.
                <br>
                <br>
                He holds degrees in Justice Administration and Non-Profit Management and has served on numerous boards supporting children, healthcare, and community development. As an 
                Assemblyman, he has sponsored a variety of bills, including those focused on tiny home development, student loan relief, school services, and environmental regulations—though no 
                formal campaign platform has been presented to explain his current agenda.

              <h6 class="page-title">Dave Bailey</h6>
              <p>          

                Assemblyman Dave Bailey does not appear to have a dedicated campaign website or centralized source of information for voters to reference. While basic profiles 
                exist on the NJ Legislature website and the Assembly Democrats site, these offer limited insight into his current campaign intentions or platform.
                <br>
                <br>
                He has not responded to direct outreach via the contact information provided to the county clerk and has not participated in any structured voter information 
                efforts like interviews or questionnaires. No upcoming or recent public events have been broadly advertised, though he was briefly spotted at Deerfield Day last 
                year and expressed a friendly attitude toward civic engagement and public access to information.
                <br>
                <br>
                Issue-based messaging specific to this election is not available. While Bailey has sponsored legislation during his time in the Assembly, it’s unclear whether any 
                particular bills reflect a present-day agenda. Without direct statements or an updated public-facing platform, voters are left to speculate.
                <br>
                <br>
                While Assemblyman Bailey does hold office and may be working behind the scenes, we encourage greater proactive transparency to ensure voters are not expected to 
                rely solely on past impressions or scattered official profiles to determine where he stands.
                <br>
                <br>
                Note: While this is technically still the primary phase, both parties are running unopposed slates, meaning all four current candidates are expected to advance to the general 
                election. This creates a valuable opportunity for candidates to begin clearly communicating their platforms early, giving voters more time to learn and engage. We encourage all 
                candidates to take advantage of this head start by providing accessible, detailed information about their agendas and priorities.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, Bailey receives a below average to average rating for transparency and accessibility.

            <li><b>Check the agenda & positions.</b> Look for the candidate’s stated agenda and issue stances. We try to group them plainly so you can compare across candidates 
                quickly.</li>
            <li><b>Read the Transparency/Accessibility rating.</b> For a deeper look at how transparent the candidate has been (web presence, interviews, follow-ups, meet n greets) and 
                how communicative they've been in response to outreach, see the rating and its short explanation. This helps you understand what’s easy to find and who is easy to 
                contact.

                If you 'just want the facts', stick to the source documents. If you want opinions about transparency, accessibility, and communication, check the transparency meter. 
                If you want coverage somewhere in between, like interviews that range from introductory to moderately pressing, watch the interviews. Choose your own adventure.</li>

                Assemblyman Dave Bailey does not currently present a public campaign platform on a campaign website, nor has he responded to outreach with specifics about his legislative 
                priorities moving forward. That said, we can look to the bills he has sponsored in the Assembly as indicators of potential areas of focus.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bailey has put forward legislation addressing school and youth services, housing innovation, healthcare, mental health, energy policy, infrastructure, and environmental concerns. 
                These include bills supporting school breakfast programs, student loan tax relief, the creation of a tiny home pilot program, improved ADA access, rural health initiatives, and 
                transparency in the use of artificial intelligence.
                <br>
                <br>
                While this legislation may suggest areas of concern or interest, it is not a substitute for a candidate’s direct explanation of their goals or priorities. Without a publicly 
                stated platform or participation in voter education efforts, we are left to infer rather than understand with clarity.
