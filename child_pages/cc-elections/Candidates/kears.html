              <p>          

                Patricia Clark-Kears is a lifelong Millville resident with decades of professional and civic experience. She spent over 30 years with the Cumberland County Board of 
                Social Services, rising from an entry-level caseworker to Director of Welfare, where she managed a $30 million budget, oversaw 240 employees, and developed policies 
                to strengthen programs supporting vulnerable residents. Earlier in her career, she helped run her family’s small business, Clark’s Liquor Store, gaining firsthand 
                understanding of the challenges local business owners face. She holds degrees from Cumberland County College and Rider University and has pursued graduate studies 
                in human development.
                <br>
                <br>
                Active in the community, Kears has been involved with the Millville Woman’s Club, Citizens United Maurice River, and the County Welfare Directors Association. She 
                has consistently attended City Commission meetings since 2022, often asking questions and offering ideas, which inspired her to run for office. She emphasizes 
                respect, transparency, and responsiveness, pledging to answer residents’ questions fully and follow up publicly when needed.
                <br>
                <br>
                Her campaign focuses on revitalizing Millville’s economic base by hiring a professional economic development director and grant writer, supporting small business 
                incubation, and pursuing eco-tourism opportunities. She is cautious about offering long-term tax abatements to corporations, prefers light industry over warehouses, 
                and supports retail cannabis sales if strictly confined to industrial zones. Additional priorities include stronger code enforcement, improved communication among 
                city leadership, more constructive work sessions, and rebuilding trust between public safety agencies and residents.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although she is a registered Democrat, Kears is running independently and stresses that she will not be beholden to any party. She believes in fairness, diversity, 
                and protecting social safety nets while using taxpayer resources responsibly. If elected, she promises to bring maturity, compassion, and a willingness to tackle 
                problems big and small, guided by the belief that good governance requires cooperation, openness, and consistent effort.

              <h6 class="page-title">Patricia Clark-Kears</h6>
              <p>          

                Patricia Clark-Kears was one of the first candidates this cycle to respond directly, providing a detailed platform that outlined her 
                background, experience, and proposals on Millville’s key issues. She also participated in a full-length radio interview and committed to an 
                additional in-depth podcast discussion closer to the election. That willingness to engage upfront stands out in a local political culture 
                where too many candidates remain vague or unavailable.
                <br>
                <br>
                Originally, I rated her at the very top tier of transparency because of how quickly and clearly she cooperated compared to the status quo. 
                But as the campaign has moved forward, I’ve noticed there have not yet been public campaign events announced or consistent social media 
                activity beyond what we already covered together. In the interest of being transparent about my own ratings, I think it’s more accurate 
                at this stage to place her in the “above average, trending toward top-tier” category.
                <br>
                <br>
                That rating still reflects meaningful openness—she’s provided more to voters than many of her peers—but it also leaves room for growth as the 
                campaign season unfolds. Continued visibility through events, regular updates, and follow-through on her commitment to future long-form 
                interviews could easily solidify a top-tier rating.

                            In terms of optics, Millville appears to be negotiating from a weakened position. The first thing seen when traveling south on Route 47 or Wheaton Avenue is debris from a demolished historic glass factory. This property should be cleaned up and developed, potentially as a mixed-use complex similar to those in other cities. Grant money and partnerships with non-profits may be options.

            <div class="experience can-sec">
                My name is Patricia Clark-Kears and I have been a life-long resident of Millville. I am seeking a four-year seat for Millville City Commission in the November 4, 
                2025 election.  My paperwork and petitions were filed with the City Clerk’s Office on February 24, 2025.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since January 2022, I have attended almost every City Commission meeting and have been one of the few people who go to the podium at almost every meeting to ask 
                questions, ask for clarification, express my satisfaction and/or dissatisfaction, and offer suggestions/ideas.  This experience led me to the decision to run for a 
                commission seat.  
                <br>
                <br>
                If elected, I will treat every person at the meetings with courtesy, dignity, respect and maturity and will treat my fellow commissioners with the same.  More 
                importantly, I will answer all questions asked as long as it does not violate privacy or confidentiality restrictions.  If I do not have an answer, I will make 
                every attempt to not only answer the question by email to the person asking, but will include the question and answer at the next commission meeting during my 
                report to citizens.  This would be a way to communicate issues in a transparent manner.  It is important to me that citizens feel not only that they matter, but 
                their concerns are important and their issues are addressed in a timely and professional manner. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Our form of government in Millville is called the Walsh Act and we have a commission of five members who are equal.  We need to work together.  My responses to the 
                questions given to me paint a broad picture of my vision and ideas for Millville.  I know many of my ideas are very optimistic and I know there will be some who 
                negatively respond but my philosophy is that you have to start somewhere. Solving little issues can lead to solving bigger problems. Millville’s problems are like a 
                ball of tangled knotted string.  Someone has to pull at a string to start to find how to unravel the knots and smooth them out.  I do not know which department I 
                would get if elected to the Commission and am willing to take on the task of whatever is given to me. I will work in cooperation with the four other commissioners 
                in a thoughtful, respectful and mature way.  This is a start that will evolve as I do more research and talk to more folks in our City for their ideas, concerns 
                and points of view.
                <br>
                <br>
                Good governance is very difficult. It requires cooperation, maturity and caring about the job given to you.  I will do the best that I can and that is the best I 
                can promise.

                                <summary style="color: blue;">Clark’s Liquor Store (1971 – 1983)</summary>
                                My family owned this small business (referred to as “The Store” by our family) in Millville for over 60 years; The Store was sold in 1998 when my 
                                parents finally retired. I worked here full-time when attending CCC and part-time when attending Rider during weekends, school breaks and summers 
                                until I obtained a full-time job after obtaining my BA. I then continued to work part-time as well until I started a family in 1983. This gave me 
                                the opportunity to have hands-on experiences with small family-owned business. It also developed my people skills by dealing with the public one on 
                                one. When my parents went away (not often) or were ill, I was given the responsibility to run the store in their absence. This provided me with 
                                invaluable experience whether it was through ordering stock, scheduling employee work hours, preparing payroll, reconciling lottery sales and 
                                handling the day-to-day operations. It was real life training in responsibility and in the reality of working long hours and working hard to become 
                                successful.
                                <br><br>
                                Most of all, “The Store” gave me insight and an appreciation for the challenges that small businesses face, even more so in today’s economy.

                                <summary style="color: blue;">Cumberland County Board of Social Services (1976 – 2010)</summary>
                                I had more of an education working in the world of social services and it had a huge impact on me. I was exposed, not in a bad way, to a world I had 
                                never seen when growing up. I did home visits for people recertifying their food stamp benefits and had no transportation into the office. I entered 
                                homes that many times were no more than tarpaper covered shacks with dirt floors, boards where window panes once were, leaky kerosene stoves as their 
                                main heat source, and a bed, chair and table. I will never forget my first home visit to a place like this and the gentleman was eating cold fish 
                                in water at ten in the morning. I had no idea that places like this existed in Cumberland County and it gave me a real appreciation for what I have. 
                                It also gave me compassion and empathy for people in need that has carried with me throughout my entire lifetime and helped shape who I am today.
