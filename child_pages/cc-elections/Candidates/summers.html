                As of 7/8/2025, we still don't have any information on this candidate. As a reminder, we reach out through information obtained through whichever clerk's office 
                is appropriate, basic google searches, and public comments at appropriate governmental meetings. In other words, a lack of information on this site should not be 
                perceived as a lack of effort on our part, we simply haven't received anything yet.

            <li><b>Read the Transparency/Accessibility rating.</b> For a deeper look at how transparent the candidate has been (web presence, interviews, follow-ups, meet n greets) and 
                how communicative they've been in response to outreach, see the rating and its short explanation. This helps you understand what’s easy to find and who is easy to 
                contact.

                If you 'just want the facts', stick to the source documents. If you want opinions about transparency, accessibility, and communication, check the transparency meter. 
                If you want coverage somewhere in between, like interviews that range from introductory to moderately pressing, watch the interviews. Choose your own adventure.</li>

                <p>
                At the Millville Car Show, Steven Solof of InformTheVoteNJ.com caught up with Robert McQuade and David Summers, both candidates for
                Millville City Commissioner. In this on-the-ground conversation, McQuade and Summers discuss the energy of this year’s car show,
                their backgrounds, and what they hope to accomplish if elected.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>McQuade’s Priorities:</strong><br>
                McQuade explains he’s seeking to return to the Commission to finish projects he helped launch — cleaning and beautifying city streets,
                working alongside the Streets and Roads Department, and addressing unfinished clean-up sites. He also outlines his interest in 21st Century
                grants to create after-school and weekend activities for youth and reopening the local lake for family recreation.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Community Event — Millville Neighborhood Cleanup Day:</strong><br>
                This brings up an upcoming community event hosted by the Holly City Development Corporation:
                <em>Thursday, September 25, 1:00–5:00 PM</em>. Registration link:

                <a href="#" rel="nofollow noopener">link to come after Google verification</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Summers on Homelessness &amp; Outreach:</strong><br>
                Summers draws on his past with car clubs to describe the event’s record turnout and pivots to homelessness and outreach, saying that many
                people are unaware of the bus service to the shelter or the process for receiving benefits. Both candidates stress the need for better
                communication and community participation, from clean-up days to churches helping connect services.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Closing Notes:</strong><br>
                The interview closes with McQuade giving out his personal phone number for residents to reach him (<span style="white-space:nowrap;">609-501-2437</span>)
                and noting his long-time volunteer service picking up and disposing of unwanted televisions. Summers emphasizes that many people need liaisons to help
                navigate “due process” and access existing programs.
