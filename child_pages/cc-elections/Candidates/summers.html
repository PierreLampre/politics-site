              <p>          

                David Summers is a first-time Millville City Commission candidate with over three decades of local manufacturing experience at Wheaton/NIPRO as a CNC operator, programmer, and 
                supervisor. He’s known for bringing his own heavy equipment to volunteer cleanups, emphasizing citywide cleanliness, fair trash policy, and listening directly to residents through 
                door-to-door outreach and a weekly call-in radio show. Summers supports rebuilding local press, practical civics education, and better information access so people can more easily 
                navigate city services.

              <h4 class="quick-sum">Rating Explanation</h4>
              <h6 class="page-title">David Summers</h6>
              <p> David Summers is a first-time candidate who has shown early signs of accessibility and openness. His initial interviews with InformTheVoteNJ were brief but cordial, giving voters 
                a basic sense of his background and priorities. He has since continued co-hosting a weekly call-in radio show with Robert McQuade, where residents can ask questions live — a 
                positive signal of ongoing engagement. 
                <br><br> 
                While his campaign messaging is still developing, Summers has proactively invited InformTheVoteNJ to do a walkthrough of his day 
                job to discuss his work and expand on his platform in greater depth. This willingness to open up his workplace and provide more context about his skills and approach suggests a 
                trajectory toward stronger transparency. 
                <br><br> 
                Given these factors, Summers currently holds an <strong>“Average (Trending Upwards)”</strong> transparency rating. To raise that rating further, he would benefit from 
                consolidating his positions into a detailed, public-facing platform and participating in longer-form interviews that explore his agenda beyond surface-level issues.

            <li><b>Read the Transparency/Accessibility rating.</b> For a deeper look at how transparent the candidate has been (web presence, interviews, follow-ups, meet n greets) and 
                how communicative they've been in response to outreach, see the rating and its short explanation. This helps you understand what’s easy to find and who is easy to 
                contact.

            <li><b>Use the page as a multi-layered hub.</b> 
                If you 'just want the facts', stick to the source documents. If you want opinions about transparency, accessibility, and communication, check the transparency meter. 
                If you want coverage somewhere in between, like interviews that range from introductory to moderately pressing, watch the interviews. Choose your own adventure.</li>

                <p>
                At the Millville Car Show, Steven Solof of InformTheVoteNJ.com caught up with Robert McQuade and David Summers, both candidates for
                Millville City Commissioner. In this on-the-ground conversation, McQuade and Summers discuss the energy of this year’s car show,
                their backgrounds, and what they hope to accomplish if elected.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>McQuade’s Priorities:</strong><br>
                McQuade explains he’s seeking to return to the Commission to finish projects he helped launch — cleaning and beautifying city streets,
                working alongside the Streets and Roads Department, and addressing unfinished clean-up sites. He also outlines his interest in 21st Century
                grants to create after-school and weekend activities for youth and reopening the local lake for family recreation.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Community Event — Millville Neighborhood Cleanup Day:</strong><br>
                This brings up an upcoming community event hosted by the Holly City Development Corporation:
                <em>Thursday, September 25, 1:00–5:00 PM</em>. Registration link:
                <!-- Replace # with the verified registration URL -->
                <a href="#" rel="nofollow noopener">link to come after Google verification</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Summers on Homelessness &amp; Outreach:</strong><br>
                Summers draws on his past with car clubs to describe the event’s record turnout and pivots to homelessness and outreach, saying that many
                people are unaware of the bus service to the shelter or the process for receiving benefits. Both candidates stress the need for better
                communication and community participation, from clean-up days to churches helping connect services.
                </p>

                <p>
                <strong>Closing Notes:</strong><br>
                The interview closes with McQuade giving out his personal phone number for residents to reach him (<span style="white-space:nowrap;">609-501-2437</span>)
                and noting his long-time volunteer service picking up and disposing of unwanted televisions. Summers emphasizes that many people need liaisons to help
                navigate “due process” and access existing programs.

                    Steven Solof (InformTheVoteNJ.com) joins <em>The Talk Around Millville</em> on WVLT 92.1 FM with
                    <strong>Robert McQuade</strong> and <strong>David Summers</strong>, both candidates for Millville City Commissioner.
                    The conversation spotlights Summers’ background and priorities—hands-on city cleanups, common-sense trash policy,
                    and listening to residents—while weaving in McQuade’s experience on the school board and commission, plus caller Q&amp;A
                    on roads, rentals/code enforcement, and youth activities.

                    <strong>About the show:</strong><br>
                    <em>The Talk Around Millville</em> is a <strong>weekly, call-in</strong> program hosted by McQuade &amp; Summers, inviting residents to discuss
                    Millville’s needs—making the candidates regularly <strong>accessible, transparent, and communicative</strong>.<br>
                    📅 <strong>Tuesdays, 6–7 PM</strong> &nbsp;•&nbsp; 📻 <strong>WVLT 92.1 FM</strong> &nbsp;•&nbsp; ☎️ <strong>(856) 696-0092</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Highlights:</strong><br>
                    Summers’ 30+ years in local manufacturing (Wheaton/NIPRO), CNC programming &amp; supervision, and hands-on community
                    cleanups (brought his own heavy equipment). Priorities include citywide cleanups, revisiting “trash tax” policy,
                    and a campaign “listening tour.” The group discusses rebuilding local press so residents and candidates can track issues,
                    practical civics education so people know how to navigate City Hall, Broad St. paving responsibilities, police staffing
                    limits for foot/bike patrols, and youth recreation ideas.

                <summary style="color: blue;"><strong>City Cleanliness & Targeted Street Improvements</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    David Summers prioritizes hands-on cleanup and maintenance across Millville. He has personally joined
                    volunteer efforts—bringing his own heavy equipment—to clear problem areas such as sections along the
                    railroad tracks, and he praises recent Parks &amp; Recreation cleanups as momentum to build on. If elected,
                    he wants to identify hotspot corridors with residents and city staff, then keep those areas on a regular
                    cleanup schedule.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Summers’ approach is practical: focus on the visible, high-impact areas first; coordinate volunteers and
                    departments to reduce backlog; and make it easy for neighbors to report issues so crews can respond
                    efficiently.

                <summary style="color: blue;"><strong>Fair, Common-Sense Trash Policy</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    Based on resident feedback, Summers wants to revisit Millville’s trash policies so costs are shared
                    fairly. He has voiced concerns about “trash tax” structures and loopholes that shift large-scale
                    disposal costs onto everyday residents. His position: sizeable complexes and corporations should handle
                    (and pay for) their own removal rather than burdening taxpayers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The goal is to keep neighborhoods clean without penalizing households that already follow the rules, while
                    ensuring the biggest waste producers carry their share of the load.

                <summary style="color: blue;"><strong>Listening Tour & Resident Surveys</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    Summers plans a campaign-trail “listening tour” to gather specific neighborhood concerns and use that input
                    to shape priorities. He also supports open phone lines through a weekly call-in radio format so residents
                    can raise issues in real time and hear responses immediately.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    He views this two-way feedback loop—door-to-door conversations plus on-air call-ins—as essential to setting
                    a grounded agenda that reflects what people actually need on their block.

                <p>
                    Summers supports efforts to strengthen local press and centralized civic information so residents (and
                    candidates) can see what’s happening without going on a scavenger hunt. He’s in favor of streamlining how
                    meetings, surveys, and updates are covered and shared, including citizen livestreams where appropriate.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Clearer, more consistent coverage makes it easier for people to follow issues, compare proposals, and hold
                    local government accountable.

                <p>
                    Summers emphasizes making city processes easier to navigate. From knowing which department to call to
                    understanding available services (e.g., transportation to shelters), he supports “liaison” style help that
                    connects residents to the right resources and explains next steps.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    He also supports re-introducing practical civics education so people can advocate confidently, follow up
                    appropriately, and keep good ideas moving.

                <p>
                    Summers and McQuade are running as a ticket and stress collaboration as a top priority. Summers is clear:
                    effective governance requires coalition-building—whoever wins needs to work together to deliver results for
                    residents.

                <p>
                    Summers wants predictable cleanup for known trouble areas (e.g., along rail corridors and other litter
                    hotspots) and an easy way for residents to flag problems. He favors blending volunteer days with scheduled
                    city work so improvements stick.

                    Summers questions policies that shift large-producer waste costs onto residents. He supports reviewing
                    fees, contracts, and enforcement so apartment complexes and corporate owners handle their own trash
                    removal—keeping the burden off households that already comply.

                    Summers highlights basic awareness gaps—like residents not knowing about bus service to shelters or how to
                    start benefit applications. He supports clear, well-advertised information plus community partners (churches,
                    nonprofits, civic groups) to make navigation easier and connect people to help faster.

                    Through a weekly call-in radio format and on-the-ground visits, Summers encourages residents to raise
                    concerns, compare ideas, and pressure-test solutions in public. He sees regular, accessible conversation as
                    foundational to trust and effective problem-solving.
