              <p>          

                Yolanda Garcia Balicki, a veteran attorney and former Deputy Executive Director of the NJ State Parole Board, is running alongside former Commissioner John 
                Capizola, Jr. as part of a Democratic ticket for Cumberland County Commissioner. Balicki brings a notable résumé, with decades of public service, civic 
                involvement, and legal work—particularly in immigration law and educational advocacy.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, a strong professional background is not a substitute for campaign transparency, and voters looking for detailed stances from Balicki may be left wanting. 
                As of now, her campaign—jointly run with Capizola—has provided only general messaging via a shared Facebook page. The page references the desire to “restore a 
                successful county government” in the spirit of prior Democratic leadership, but lacks specifics on current county issues like infrastructure, social services, 
                economic development, or transparency itself. A recent social media post indicated she would be meeting voters at a flea market, but the post was same-day and didn’t 
                list a time, leaving little chance for voters to engage unless they happened to be there already.
                <br>
                <br>
                Given her experience, one would hope for a more organized and accessible campaign effort. Instead, voters are left piecing things together while the campaign’s 
                online presence remains mostly dormant, and the local party infrastructure offers no supplemental visibility. The party website still lists no events, and the 
                candidates’ digital channels are largely silent on meaningful local policy.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is not a personal critique—it’s a civic observation. Balicki is one of only three Democrats competing for two seats, meaning she is likely to advance to the 
                general election. That inevitability raises the bar for engagement. Voters deserve to hear directly from candidates on how they would lead, what differentiates them 
                from their Republican opponents, and how they plan to address the well-documented challenges Cumberland County faces. The experience is there—but the communication 
                isn’t.

              <h6 class="page-title">Yolanda Balicki</h6>
              <p>          

                Yolanda Garcia Balicki is no stranger to public service or professional leadership. A former Deputy Executive Director of the NJ State Parole Board with over three decades of 
                government experience, she currently practices immigration law in Vineland and Bridgeton, serves as President of the Cumberland County Bar Association, and has held various 
                community-facing roles throughout the region.
                <br>
                <br>
                Which makes it all the more surprising that her current campaign lacks any clear or accessible public-facing materials. As of this writing, there is no campaign website, no 
                social media outreach, no publicly advertised events, and no updated statements outlining her goals for the Board of Commissioners in 2025.
                <br>
                <br>
                Despite multiple outreach attempts through known channels, we have received no response from the candidate, and voters have no clear way of learning where she stands on 
                county-specific issues such as infrastructure development, fiscal priorities, or inter-municipal coordination. The only messaging available comes from her 2021 State Senate 
                campaign, which, while informative about her character and motivation, cannot be assumed to reflect her current platform for this office.
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s also important to note: like others in this race, Garcia Balicki works locally and lives within minutes of the communities she would serve. After two years of 
                systematically trying to gather candidate information from within our own backyard, it should not still be this difficult to hear from those seeking public office.
                <br>
                <br>
                If a candidate with such a long resume in public systems and community engagement isn’t already proactively informing the public about their vision, it raises concerns about 
                how seriously they’re taking the responsibility of campaigning in the digital age. As a potential leader, a basic, accessible campaign infrastructure should be a given—not 
                an afterthought.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, this rating is not set in stone. Candidates can improve their transparency score by completing a questionnaire, publishing a campaign site or platform summary, or 
                agreeing to participate in a recorded interview. This platform exists to inform the public—it is not about chasing scoops or elevating personalities. The goal is simply to 
                centralize and clarify the information voters deserve.
                <br>
                <br>
                Speculating that our outreach has ulterior motives misses the mark. It’s 2025, and the burden should not fall on voters or independent platforms to chase down basic 
                information. The county itself should already have a better process in place for helping residents understand their choices.
                <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, Yolanda Garcia Balicki currently receives a below-average rating for transparency and accessibility.
