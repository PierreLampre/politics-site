                <p>Inform the Vote spoke with Perella at Deerfield Day. Seems to be very focused on public water and sewage issues in county. The cost of getting sewage and water up to code for residences and businesses is so high currently that it is preventing new business investment and the sale of residences. Perella is suggesting applying for federal grants to expand water and sewage.</p>
                <p>It is the opinion of Inform the Vote that this candidate is one of the only candidates in this year's election to clearly explain their action plan for implementing their agenda. Spoke at Deerfield Day and multiple Middle Mile Committee Meetings, in regards to their agenda to expand broadand internet access. Believes that in the year 2023 internet access is integral to the community. While acknowledging that the Middle Mile will not connect the end user, she believes it is an essential first step in the process and proper oversight will be conducted.</p>
                <p>Also mentioned their commitment to bringing awareness to mental illness, depression, and suicide. Her implementation plan is to get more social workers and counselors into county schools.</p>

               has been a member of the Tri-County Rotary and has participated in many of the community

               <p>She also worked with the club to put on a small

            <h4 class="sub-heading">Candidates Forum Statements</h4>
            <div class="experience">
                
               When asked what makes Dr. Perella the most qualified candidate for Commissioner at the Candidates Forum held at 
               Bridgeton High School, the Dr. spoke about how their involvement in their dentistry practice gives them access to 
               many perspectives learned from their patients. This angle helps keep their 'ear to the ground' regarding county issues.
                <br>
                <br>
               When asked how to manage the county budget, Perella spoke about leveraging grant money from the state. They also spoke 
               about how the lack of funding in the county led to the closure of a fire hall in Upper Deerfield.
               <br>
               <br>
               When asked from an audience member about gun violence at schools, Perella made it clear that they did not support armed 
               security in the schools because the data shows it doesn't work and then referenced a story in Florida about how an 
               armed security guard did not engage a shooter. The reference to the Florida incident was contested by the audience member,
               where the audience member claimed it was against the Florida school's policy to engage, implying that an armed guard 
               could have prevented the incident if policy had allowed.

                <h4><strong>Summarized/Paraphrased Q&A</strong></h4>
                To note: A "general discussion point" is a summarized part of the video that might not have come from a direct question and 
                answer format, but part of a tangent or general discussion.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                1. Host: What does a county commissioner do?
                <br>
                <br>
                Perella: Oversees administrative system, county court system, sheriff’s department, administer county roads, department 
                of health, veterans affairs. In Cumberland county they used to be called freeholders.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Host: Would you say that the commissioner’s board is like a mini senate?
                <br>
                <br>
                Perella: It's more of an executive function. Executive functions have been delegated to the commissioner’s board through the 
                state. “Very important stuff.”
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Host: What made you decide to run for office?
                <br>
                <br>
                Perella: Lived here my whole life. Helped shape me into the person I am today, so I want to give back to the community. We have 
                a lot of issues, so I want to be part of those solutions.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                4. Host: How does the fact that Cumberland County being not only the poorest county in the state, but also poorer than parts of 
                Appalachia, factor into your campaign’s platform?
                <br>
                <br>
                It informs everything that my platform is based around. We have some of the highest child poverty rate’s in the state. Our 
                health outcomes and life expectancy are the lowest in the state. It helps create a blueprint of priorities. We have a lack of 
                investment, we are a forgotten community. I want to protect our rural identity, but I don’t want that to prevent us from 
                prospering.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                5. Host: As a commissioner, would you be in contact with the federal government, or more with the state government to get resources 
                to the county?
                <br>
                <br>
                Perella: Both. As a county commissioner you have to be an advocate or cheerleader for your own community. We have to put in
                the work to get grants and loans. There is an overwhelming amount of districts in the state, so we need to have a loud 
                voice to persuade other legislators to invest here.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                6. General discussion point: Bridgeton has become a food desert, despite the fact that the county has an abundant 
                agriculture industry… yet we don’t necessarily supply that food to our own residents. We have made some progress in this 
                area recently, but we definitely have more work to do.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                7. Host: What are the political demographics of Cumberland County? 
                <br>
                <br>
                Perella: These are the raw numbers - 38,000 registered independents. 33,000 registered democrats. 23,000 registered republicans.
                So while one might assume the county leans blue/left, it has actually been leaning right in terms of election results. A lot of 
                this depends on voter turnout… Can you get your registered voters to actually vote? From 2020 to 2022, voter turnout went from 
                70-75 percent to 32 percent. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                8. Host: What do you think the implications of this race will be?
                <br>
                <br>
                Perella: People are comfortable with it being a blue state. However, we’re always only 2 elections away from losing that. So in this 
                year, the entire state senate and general assembly is up for election. We want to protect our legislative majorities.

                9. Host: What is the current makeup of the commissioner’s board?
                <br>
                <br>
                Perella: 4 are republican, 3 are democrat. The 3 democrat seats are up for grabs, so they could all potentially flip to 
                republican.

                Perella: While there isn’t a direct comparison, seeing patients daily gives me an opportunity to have an ear to the ground 
                to what’s going on in the community and know the current issues constituents are facing.

                11. Host: If the republicans take control of either the state senate or general assembly, what might be the results?
                <br>
                <br>
                Perella: In the short term, we would have a split government. Possible political gridlock. Progress and work for the 
                budget and legislation would stop because they would be arguing all the time. And in time, if republicans take control 
                of the state senate, general assembly, and the governorship, we could lose our social safety net. We need investment in
                broadband infrastructure, more public water and sewer access… we can’t afford these things on our own.
