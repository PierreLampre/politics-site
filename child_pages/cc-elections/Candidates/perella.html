                Inform the Vote spoke with Perella at Deerfield Day. Seems to be very focused on public water and sewage issues in county.  
                The cost of getting sewage and water up to code for residences and businesses is so high currently that it is preventing new business investment 
                and the sale of residences.  Perella is suggesting applying for federal grants to expand water and sewage.  It is the opinion of Inform the Vote that
                this candidate is one of the only candidates in this year's election to clearly explain their action plan for implementing their agenda. Spoke at Deerfield Day and multiple Middle
                Mile Committee Meetings, in regards to their agenda to expand broadand internet access. Believes that in the year 2023 internet access is integral to the community.
                While acknowledging that the Middle Mile will not connect the end user, she believes it is an essential first step in the process and proper oversight will be conducted.
                Also mentioned their commitment to bringing awareness to mental illness, depression, and suicide.  Her implementation plan is to get more social workers and counselors into county schools.

               Works as a dentist. When she isnâ€™t treating patients Joeigh can be found spending time on 
               the many community service and volunteer organizations she is involved with. Since 2019 she 
               has been a member of the Tri-County Rotary and has participated in many of the community 
               service events; including Loads of Love, a project started by the club to help community 
               members afford their cost of doing laundry. She also worked with the club to put on a small 
               free dental clinic in 2021. For these efforts she was recognized by the Regional Rotarian 
               Governor in 2021. The following year Joeigh was awarded the Business Professional Award at 
               the Millville Chamber of Commerce Pride of Millville event.
