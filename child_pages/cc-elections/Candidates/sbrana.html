                As of 10/13/2025, we still don't have any information on this candidate. As a reminder, we reach out through information obtained through whichever clerk's office 
                is appropriate, basic google searches, and public comments at appropriate governmental meetings. In other words, a lack of information on this site should not be 
                perceived as a lack of effort on our part, we simply haven't received anything yet.

            <li><b>Read the Transparency/Accessibility rating.</b> For a deeper look at how transparent the candidate has been (web presence, interviews, follow-ups, meet n greets) and 
                how communicative they've been in response to outreach, see the rating and its short explanation. This helps you understand what’s easy to find and who is easy to 
                contact.

                If you 'just want the facts', stick to the source documents. If you want opinions about transparency, accessibility, and communication, check the transparency meter. 
                If you want coverage somewhere in between, like interviews that range from introductory to moderately pressing, watch the interviews. Choose your own adventure.</li>

            <p> <strong>John Sbrana</strong> is a lifelong Vineland resident, Vineland High School graduate (’68), and veteran educator–communicator who 
                spent two decades leading the district’s public information and broadcast operations before joining the Board of Education. Now serving 
                as <strong>Vice President</strong> and chair of the <strong>Personnel & Policy Committee</strong>, Sbrana brings extensive institutional 
                knowledge and a reputation for steady, detail-driven leadership. </p> 
                
                <p> His agenda centers on <strong>reducing absenteeism</strong> through engaging curriculum, <strong>parent partnerships</strong>, and 
                    strong staff morale. He emphasizes <strong>career pathways</strong> such as trades, auto tech, and the revitalized <strong>Future 
                        Farmers of America</strong> program, alongside core academic excellence and life-skills instruction. </p> 
                        
                        <p> Key issue priorities include maintaining <strong>safe schools</strong> with well-trained SROs, protecting and modernizing 
                            <strong>facilities</strong>, and ensuring <strong>clear advancement paths</strong> for educators and staff to retain local 
                            talent. Guided by a communications-based “truth-first” philosophy, Sbrana values practical transparency, long-term planning, 
                            and keeping Vineland schools competitive, engaging, and community-connected. </p>

                  <strong>Explanation</strong>
              </summary>
              <p> John Sbrana’s transparency and accessibility reflect the balance of a long-time incumbent with deep community roots and a busy 
                professional record who entered the campaign phase later than some of his challengers. For newer or younger voters—including those who 
                have only recently begun following local elections—Sbrana was not necessarily a familiar name at the start of the race. In a field of 
                eight candidates competing for three school board seats, that unfamiliarity matters—but so does the broader context. </p> 

                <p> Roughly half of this year’s candidates offered little to no public campaign messaging at all. Against that backdrop, Sbrana’s 
                    willingness to respond to outreach, complete the <strong>InformTheVoteNJ questionnaire</strong>, and participate in a full-length, 
                    hour-long interview demonstrates a clear level of openness and accountability. During the interview, he provided detailed, 
                    experience-based insight into absenteeism, curriculum, staffing, and safety—showing that he not only understands the system, but has 
                    helped shape it over multiple decades. </p> 
                    
                    <p> Any speculation that he could have done more to campaign publicly can reasonably be 
                        attributed to the <strong>status quo of Cumberland County elections</strong>, where candidate forums, centralized meet-and-greets, 
                        and county-facilitated outreach are still not routine. In that environment, <strong>legacy and credibility can substitute for 
                            visibility</strong>, and Sbrana’s long-term involvement, committee leadership, and responsiveness place him a bit above 
                            average for transparency and accessibility this election cycle. </p>

            <div style="padding: 15px 25px; text-align: left;">
                <p><strong>Interview Context:</strong> In this InformTheVoteNJ Radio Hour conversation, <strong>John Sbrana</strong>—long-time Vineland Public Schools employee (communications/broadcasting), current BOE member and vice president—discusses what he’s learned on the board and his priorities going forward.</p>

                <p><strong>Incumbency & Approach:</strong> Despite decades filming and following meetings, Sbrana says serving on the board had a steep learning curve; most real work happens in <em>committee sessions</em>. His media background shapes a truth-first ethos—he resists narrative “spin” and prioritizes clear communication.</p>

                <p><strong>Student Engagement & Attendance:</strong> “Kids can’t learn if they’re not in their seats.” He links absenteeism to <em>engaging curriculum</em>, <em>passionate teachers</em>, and <em>parent involvement</em> (including practical touches like food at events). He supports strengthening the home-school connection while ensuring breakfast/lunch access for students in need.</p>

                <p><strong>Curriculum & Pathways:</strong> Double down on fundamentals (reading, writing, math), expand <em>life-skills/financial literacy</em>, and grow <em>trades</em> pathways. He highlights the revival of FFA with a new greenhouse and a planned farm site, plus auto tech and related hands-on programs.</p>

                <p><strong>Safety & SROs:</strong> Proud to have helped implement school resource officers; hiring/training continues under program leadership, with prevention and coordination alongside juvenile officers.</p>

                <p><strong>Facilities:</strong> Vineland leveraged significant state capital funds for new buildings and now focuses on maintenance (HVAC, roofs, windows) and decisions on older facilities (e.g., Cunningham), balancing renovation vs. disposition.</p>

                <p><strong>Staffing & Retention:</strong> Create clear growth paths so “homegrown” talent stays; prefer local hires when candidates are close, but always choose the best qualified. He pushes against practices that drive strong educators elsewhere.</p>

                <p><strong>Differentiators:</strong> Recent service on the <em>Personnel & Policy</em> committee, near-perfect meeting attendance, and spearheading a third-generation <em>broadcast truck</em> that functions as a mobile lab integrated with classroom programs.</p>

                <p><strong>Closing:</strong> Encourages all voters to participate; frames the work as meaningful and worth continuing.</p>

                    Reduce absenteeism by making school worth showing up for: <strong>engaging curriculum</strong>, 
                    <strong>passionate teachers</strong>, and practical <strong>parent involvement</strong>. 
                    Sbrana favors meet-ups that mix short info sessions with food to boost turnout and strengthen the home–school connection. 
                    He also supports ensuring <strong>breakfast and lunch</strong> access so students’ basic needs don’t block learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    He stresses that strong, intact home support correlates with achievement; the district can help by <strong>bridging schools and families</strong> 
                    through welcoming events and clear, regular communication.

                    Double down on fundamentals—<strong>reading, writing, math</strong>—while expanding practical pathways:
                    <strong>life-skills/financial literacy</strong>, <strong>trades</strong>, and hands-on programs. 
                    Highlights include the revitalized <strong>Future Farmers of America</strong> (greenhouse now; planned farm site next) and <strong>auto tech</strong>, 
                    with an eye toward making coursework relevant and job-ready.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As engagement rises, attendance follows; Sbrana links these themes directly to his absenteeism strategy.
