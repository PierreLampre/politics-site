              <h6 class="page-title">Jeff Van Drew</h6>
              <p>
                Congressman Jeff Van Drew represents New Jersey's 2nd Congressional District. He started his political career as a Democrat, serving in the New Jersey General 
                Assembly and the New Jersey State Senate before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018. He switched to the Republican Party in December 2019 
                following his opposition to the impeachment of President Donald Trump, a move that garnered both praise and criticism from various political circles.
                <br>
                Van Drew's record in Congress includes voting for the Lower Energy Costs Act, which aims to increase domestic energy production and reduce permitting restrictions,
                and supporting a resolution to end the national coronavirus state of emergency declared in 2020. He has also been active in legislative efforts such as the Dental 
                Loan Repayment Assistance Act of 2024, acquiring funding for the Middle Mile Broadband project for Cumberland County, and has shown a consistent alignment 
                with Republican positions on key votes.
                <br>
                Looking ahead to the 2024 election season, Van Drew aims to continue his advocacy for economic opportunities and job creation in South Jersey. His agenda 
                focuses on lowering energy costs, maintaining fiscal responsibility, and opposing policies he views as socialist. He emphasizes his dedication to serving 
                his constituents by addressing their concerns and promoting policies that benefit the local economy and community well-being.
