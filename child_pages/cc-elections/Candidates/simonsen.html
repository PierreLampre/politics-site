              <p>          

                Erik Simonsen is seeking re-election to the New Jersey General Assembly, where he represents the 1st Legislative District alongside Senator Mike Testa and 
                Assemblyman Antwan McClellan. In his own words, the campaign message centers on defending South Jersey’s way of life—sustaining tourism, agriculture, small 
                businesses, and working families in a region often overlooked by Trenton. He emphasizes LD1’s bipartisan track record despite being in the minority, noting 
                success in passing legislation through cooperation across the aisle. At the same time, he pushes back against policies crafted for North Jersey that don’t 
                fit local realities—such as attempts to upend tipping culture or weaken family-owned farms. Simonsen frames the race as a fight to keep South Jersey’s economy, 
                traditions, and communities strong, while securing a fairer return on tax dollars sent to the state.
                <br>
                <br>
                His broader agenda reflects long-held conservative principles and priorities for Cape May, Cumberland, and Atlantic Counties. He calls for tax relief, balanced 
                budgets, and reduced state debt; investment in healthcare, education, and infrastructure; and revitalization of small businesses that anchor local economies. 
                He supports parental rights in education, affordable housing that respects municipal control, and policies that keep South Jersey a place where families can 
                thrive across generations. Simonsen also champions public safety, veterans, and military families, while defending fisheries, farming, and natural resources 
                as central to the region’s identity. Taken together, his record and platform aim to pair fiscal discipline with a clear commitment to preserving the South 
                Jersey way of life.

              <h6 class="page-title">Erik Simonsen</h6>
              <p>          

                Assemblymen Erik Simonsen and Antwan McClellan have now followed through on earlier outreach commitments by participating in full-length radio interviews with 
                InformTheVoteNJ. This represents a meaningful step forward in accessibility, building on their past willingness to attend public events and maintain visibility 
                beyond party-insider circles. At this stage in the cycle, their accessibility is clearly trending toward the top of the regional field.
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, achieving a full transparency and accessibility rating ideally should require additional engagement. Firstly, exposure to a tougher, in-depth interview 
                format where candidates are pressed on clarifying positions and addressing complex or polarizing issues. These are the kinds of conversations that help voters move 
                beyond talking points and test how candidates explain themselves under scrutiny. Without such opportunities, even cooperative candidates risk being seen as operating 
                within the region’s generally low expectations for campaign visibility.
                <br>
                <br>
                In fairness, Simonsen has shown a greater openness to public interaction than some of his peers, often engaging with constituents through music gigs, athletic 
                events, and community appearances. But as a second aspect of overall engagement, the challenge is less about his personal willingness and more about the broader 
                political culture of South Jersey, where forums, debates, and structured public dialogues are not always standard practice. In such an environment, even accessible 
                candidates can be lumped in with a status quo of limited voter engagement.
                <br>
                <br>
                For now, Simonsen’s transparency and accessibility rating stands at above average, with a strong likelihood of reaching the full transparency tier if he 
                continues to engage in diverse media formats and participates in at least one hard-press interview before the general election.

                    <p>In this Inform the Vote NJ Radio Hour interview, Assemblyman Erik Simonsen (LD1) joins Steven Solof for an in-depth discussion about his background, legislative priorities, and campaign for re-election. Drawing on his experience as an educator, coach, musician, and deacon, Simonsen explains how these roles have shaped his approach to lawmaking and constituent service in South Jersey.</p>

                    <p><strong>Legislative Record and Policy Priorities:</strong><br>
                    Simonsen highlights his work on anti-Semitism legislation, disability rights, education, and extracurricular compensation. He frames his record as bipartisan and focused on protecting South Jersey’s unique way of life, from agriculture and tourism to tipping culture.</p>

                    <p><strong>Background and Experience:</strong><br>
                    With over 30 years in education and long-time service as a coach, professional musician, and church deacon, Simonsen shares how these roles taught him creativity, communication, and community leadership—qualities he carries into legislative debates and committee work.</p>

                    <p><strong>Civic Engagement and Reform Ideas:</strong><br>
                    The interview explores Simonsen’s strong support for reintroducing civics education, improving campaign transparency through county-facilitated candidate information, and ensuring voters better understand how local government functions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Social Issues and Reproductive Rights:</strong><br>
                    Simonsen outlines his personal pro-life stance while supporting exceptions and describing abortion as a states’ rights issue. He signals openness to compromise approaches like those discussed by gubernatorial candidates.</p>

                    <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
                    Beyond legislation, Simonsen emphasizes constituent services, local events, and grassroots engagement as the true measure of effective representation. This interview provides voters a direct look at his “body of work” and the principles guiding his re-election campaign.</p>

                    Assemblyman Erik Simonsen frames his agenda around protecting and strengthening South Jersey’s unique way of life. 
                    He emphasizes that Trenton’s policies too often prioritize North Jersey, leaving shore communities and rural towns behind. 
                    His focus is on redirecting resources and investment back home—supporting infrastructure upgrades, tourism, and agriculture 
                    so that families can thrive, young people can build their futures, and retirees can remain in the communities they love.

                    safe neighborhoods, and housing affordability. His agenda emphasizes lowering the cost of living, ensuring seniors can 
                    age in place, and promoting schools that prepare students with practical skills and values.

                    Simonsen advocates cutting red tape, reducing taxes, and fostering an environment where entrepreneurs can succeed. 
                    He views small businesses as the backbone of South Jersey’s economy and seeks to balance growth with protecting 
                    the tourism and service industries that define the region. His agenda includes championing workforce development 
                    and honoring organized labor as critical to rebuilding opportunity in the region.

                    <p>
                    With New Jersey among the highest-taxed states in the nation, Simonsen consistently opposes wasteful spending 
                    and calls for balanced budgets. His agenda emphasizes fiscal restraint and demands that state government live 
                    within its means, returning more value to taxpayers and protecting future generations from unsustainable growth.

                    Safe communities are central to Simonsen’s agenda. He supports ensuring that police, firefighters, and first responders 
                    have the resources and respect they need to keep neighborhoods secure. His approach emphasizes accountability for criminals 
                    while prioritizing protection for law-abiding families.

                    As the son of a long-time coach and mentor, Simonsen connects his agenda to service and sacrifice. He supports policies 
                    that expand job opportunities, improve healthcare, and honor veterans with the benefits they’ve earned. This commitment 
                    extends to his belief in civic education—reintroducing civics in schools so young people understand public institutions, 
                    their rights, and their responsibilities as citizens.

                    Recognizing that South Jersey’s economy depends on its natural resources, Simonsen champions fair regulations for the 
                    fishing industry, investment in ports, and protections for local farms. His agenda balances economic use of natural 
                    assets with preserving them for future generations.

                    <p>
                    Simonsen was a leading voice in committee hearings on anti-Semitism legislation, 
                    working across party lines to ensure the bill passed unanimously after addressing 
                    free speech concerns. He emphasized the importance of distinguishing between protest 
                    and harassment, noting that students must be able to attend class without fear of intimidation. 
                    Simonsen has also expressed willingness to support similar protections against anti-Muslim harassment.

                    <p>
                    Drawing on his own experience as a longtime coach, Simonsen sponsored bipartisan legislation 
                    to ensure that stipends for coaches, band leaders, theater directors, and other extracurricular 
                    mentors count toward pensions. He argues that extracurricular leaders devote countless hours 
                    beyond the classroom and deserve compensation that reflects their contribution. 
                    Simonsen has connected this fight to a broader concern about underpaid public service roles 
                    in New Jersey and the strain created by two-year Assembly terms that force legislators 
                    into perpetual campaigning.

                    <p>
                    Simonsen has championed legislation directing the state to create a <em>Career Education Guide</em> 
                    for college students with disabilities, ensuring they are not left behind after graduation. 
                    He frames this as a return-on-investment issue: if families and taxpayers fund education, 
                    students should graduate with real career pathways. Simonsen has also supported grant programs 
                    like <em>YouthBuild</em> to give at-risk and disadvantaged youth work readiness skills across South Jersey.

                    <p>
                    Simonsen warns against Trenton policies designed for North Jersey that harm South Jersey’s 
                    tourism, agriculture, and small business economy. He has opposed proposals to eliminate 
                    tipping, which he argues would devastate restaurants and hospitality workers along the shore. 
                    He continues to fight for resources to return home from Trenton, noting that LD1 sends 
                    hundreds of millions in tax revenue to the state while receiving far less back.

                    Simonsen opposes state overreach that threatens farms and open spaces, particularly 
                    mandates that allow housing development through eminent domain on farmland. 
                    He argues for municipal decision-making authority, stressing the need to balance 
                    affordable housing goals with preserving agriculture, tourism, and environmental heritage.

                    Whether as mayor, coach, or legislator, Simonsen has worked to ensure communities 
                    have the resources they need to remain safe and resilient. He often stresses that 
                    the most meaningful part of the job is direct engagement with constituents — 
                    listening at town events, church, athletic competitions, and even music gigs. 
                    He views legislation not as an abstract exercise, but as a response to real-world 
                    needs expressed by the people of LD1.

                    Personally pro-life, Simonsen cites his faith and his wife’s background as a labor 
                    and delivery nurse. He supports exceptions when the life of the mother is at risk 
                    and opposes third-trimester abortions. While he voted against New Jersey’s current law, 
                    he respects the democratic process and has stated comfort with gubernatorial candidate 
                    Jack Ciattarelli’s proposed “reasonable compromise” plan as a middle ground for the state.

                    Assemblyman Erik Simonsen was born and raised in Cape May and Lower Township, New Jersey. 
                    He graduated from Trenton State College (now The College of New Jersey) with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, 
                    completed coursework in special education at Rutgers University, and earned a Master’s degree in Educational Administration 
                    from the University of Scranton.

                    Simonsen worked in education for 32 years as a teacher, vice principal, and later Director of Athletics & Activities at 
                    Lower Cape May Regional School District. His classroom experience ranged from art and music to school-to-work programs for 
                    students with special needs. He also coached wrestling and football for many years and continues to compete as an endurance athlete.

                    Simonsen began his public service on the Lower Township Council in 2011 and later served as Mayor from 2017 to 2019. 
                    As Mayor, he emphasized fiscal conservatism, cutting taxes, building a $1.5 million municipal surplus, 
                    and leading revitalization projects along the Bayshore and Schellenger’s Landing.

                    His legislative work has included bills expanding opportunities for veterans in coaching,

                    Beyond public office, Simonsen is deeply connected to his community. He is an ordained deacon at Macedonia Baptist Church in Cape May, 
                    one of the county’s oldest congregations and home of the Harriet Tubman Museum.

                    A lifelong athlete, he continues to compete in triathlons, cycling events, and endurance races. 
                    He is also a professional musician and frontman of the band <em>Twelve:01</em>, with multiple albums released. 
                    His children’s CD <em>“E is for Erik”</em> was even considered for a Grammy nomination in 2015.

                    Family remains central to his life. He and his wife, Anna, raised two daughters, Katya and Viktoria, in Lower Township. 
                    He credits his late parents—his mother, a special education teacher, and his father, a long-time football coach—with 
                    inspiring his lifelong dedication to education, athletics, and service.
