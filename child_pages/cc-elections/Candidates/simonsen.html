              <h6 class="page-title">Erik Simonsen</h6>
              <p>          

                Assemblymen Erik Simonsen and Antwan McClellan have historically been more accessible than many local candidates in Cumberland County, 
                regularly attending Republican breakfasts and participating in public meet-and-greet events. That pattern already placed them 
                above average compared to the regional status quo, where many candidates remain largely invisible between election cycles... or at least 
                invisible to people who aren't already political insiders.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since the end of the primary election, both have made plans to expand their outreach further heading into the general election season. While 
                their joint radio interview scheduled for July 1 had to be adjusted—Erik ultimately needed to cancel—Antwan followed through and appeared 
                live on air. Erik has indicated he will reschedule his radio interview in the near future, and both plan to participate in a longer, 
                podcast-style interview later in the summer.
                <br>
                <br>
                If these commitments materialize, they will be on track to provide a reasonable amount of information and public dialogue before October, 
                when most voters begin to focus on the race in earnest.                 
                <br>
                <br>
                Given the longstanding pattern of inaccessibility that plagues many campaigns related to Cumberland County, InformTheVoteNJ will continue 
                monitoring closely to see whether these promised interviews and public appearances occur as planned.
                <br>
                <br>
                For now, based on demonstrated efforts to improve communication this cycle, Simonsen and McClellan’s transparency and accessibility merit an 
                updated rating of average to above average, with cautious optimism that further improvements will follow.

                    <p>In this Inform the Vote NJ Radio Hour interview, Assemblyman Erik Simonsen (LD1) joins Steven Solof for an in-depth discussion about his background, legislative priorities, and campaign for re-election. Drawing on his experience as an educator, coach, musician, and deacon, Simonsen explains how these roles have shaped his approach to lawmaking and constituent service in South Jersey.</p>

                    <p><strong>Legislative Record and Policy Priorities:</strong><br>
                    Simonsen highlights his work on anti-Semitism legislation, disability rights, education, and extracurricular compensation. He frames his record as bipartisan and focused on protecting South Jersey’s unique way of life, from agriculture and tourism to tipping culture.</p>

                    <p><strong>Background and Experience:</strong><br>
                    With over 30 years in education and long-time service as a coach, professional musician, and church deacon, Simonsen shares how these roles taught him creativity, communication, and community leadership—qualities he carries into legislative debates and committee work.</p>

                    <p><strong>Civic Engagement and Reform Ideas:</strong><br>
                    The interview explores Simonsen’s strong support for reintroducing civics education, improving campaign transparency through county-facilitated candidate information, and ensuring voters better understand how local government functions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Social Issues and Reproductive Rights:</strong><br>
                    Simonsen outlines his personal pro-life stance while supporting exceptions and describing abortion as a states’ rights issue. He signals openness to compromise approaches like those discussed by gubernatorial candidates.</p>

                    <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br>
                    Beyond legislation, Simonsen emphasizes constituent services, local events, and grassroots engagement as the true measure of effective representation. This interview provides voters a direct look at his “body of work” and the principles guiding his re-election campaign.</p>
