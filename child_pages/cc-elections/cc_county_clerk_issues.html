                        It is one of the roles of the County Clerk to run the county elections. While there doesn't seem to be any urgent issues regarding election integrity 
                        in Cumberland County, it is reasonable to want the best person on the job given all the concern regarding fair elections across the nation.

                        It has been said that one of the roles of a county clerk is to act as a link between the general public and the government. In our experience over the 
                        past year, we haven't been made fully aware of the scope of the Clerk's duties and we have had trouble establishing communication a few times. It would 
                        be nice to know that whomever is doing the job would be thorough about making themselves available not only while doing the job, but also while 
                        campaigning.

                        There has been some chatter regarding how well the job of clerk has been executed over the past few years, especially during covid.

                    <div class="issues-sub-content">
                        There has been some chatter regarding how party affiliations might affect the execution of the clerk's tasks. While we can not verify the following, 
                        it may be the case that conflicting agendas lead to delays and blocks on getting tasks done at the county level. Given that the elected Cumberland County 
                        government is mostly Republican at the moment, having a Republican clerk could help streamline county efforts. However, keeping a democrat clerk could 
                        help stop any unwanted Republican efforts. How much this is an actual issue is unclear.
