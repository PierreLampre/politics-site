                        The district has been facing economic challenges, particularly in areas heavily dependent on seasonal tourism and agriculture. Job creation efforts 
                        are crucial to provide stable employment opportunities year-round. For example, once a thriving hub for tourism and casinos, Atlantic City has 
                        experienced economic decline. Initiatives to diversify the local economy and attract new industries are vital. Also, many small businesses in the 
                        district have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. How will the candidates ensure that the district will grow so its residents can prosper 
                        economically?

                        Both rural and urban areas within the district face challenges in accessing affordable healthcare services. Residents often have to travel long distances 
                        to access specialized healthcare services, making the expansion of local healthcare facilities a priority. Also, The district has been significantly 
                        impacted by the opioid epidemic, necessitating robust public health responses. High rates of opioid addiction require increased funding for treatment 
                        centers and prevention programs. How will the candidates address these and/or other healthcare concerns?

                        The district's extensive coastline makes it vulnerable to climate change and sea-level rise, impacting both the environment and local economies 
                        dependent on tourism and fishing. Towns like Ocean City and Longport are dealing with frequent flooding and beach erosion, requiring investment in 
                        coastal defense and resilience projects. Also, local waterways suffer from pollution, affecting both public health and the environment.
                        Pollution and habitat destruction in the bay affect local fisheries and wildlife. How will the candidates handle these and/or other environmental 
                        concerns?

                        Adequate funding is necessary to ensure quality education in both urban and rural schools within the district. Schools in areas like Millville face challenges 
                        with funding and resources, impacting the quality of education. What is the plan for the candidates in regards to educational success in the district?
