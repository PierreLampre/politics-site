                        The district has been facing economic challenges, particularly in areas heavily dependent on seasonal tourism and agriculture. Job creation efforts 
                        are crucial to provide stable employment opportunities year-round. For example, once a thriving hub for tourism and casinos, Atlantic City has 
                        experienced economic decline. Initiatives to diversify the local economy and attract new industries are vital. Also, Many small businesses in the 
                        district have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Known for its agricultural output, Vineland benefits from programs that support local farmers and 
                        promote agri-business. Millville is also in the process of economic development with efforts such as the Nabb Ave. extension to help its industrial area. 
                        Supporting these businesses is essential for economic recovery. A pro-active congressman would help find and acquire federal funding for economic 
                        development in the district.
