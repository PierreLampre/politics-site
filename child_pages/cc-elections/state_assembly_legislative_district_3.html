          <h6 class="page-title">State Assembly - Legislative District 3</h6>
          <p>
            
            The General Assembly race in New Jersey’s 3rd Legislative District features two seats up for election. While this district mostly covers Gloucester and Salem counties, 
            it includes parts of Cumberland County representing about 17,000 people—so it deserves attention here.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the Republican side, Chris Konawel and Lawrence Moore are running unopposed. Like other local Republicans, they’ve often been accessible through the bi-weekly breakfasts in 
            the past. But with those meetings now closed to non-Republicans, any updates that might have been shared there are no longer readily available to the wider public.
            <br>
            <br>
            I tried to meet both candidates in person to help establish trust and open lines of communication. I attended a Harrison Township meeting specifically hoping to connect with 
            Lawrence Moore, but he was absent that evening. Some of his colleagues said they would pass along my message and materials, but so far, there has been no reply. This is a 
            good example of how cumbersome and hit-or-miss the process can be, even when you make the effort to show up in person.
            <br>
            <br>
            I did speak briefly with Chris Konawel at a bi-weekly breakfast, so he is aware of this outreach and the platform I’m offering. But to date, neither candidate has provided 
            detailed campaign information or followed up to schedule interviews. To be fair, Konawel did make some brief campaign-related statements at a breakfast and he does appear to be 
            picking up steam on social media, but we'll see how it plays out throughout the season.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the Democratic side, Heather Simmons and Dave Bailey also ran unopposed in the primary. While I haven’t been able to connect with either directly despite multiple attempts by 
            email, phone, and mail, it’s worth noting that Dave Bailey did make an appearance at the Cumberland County Fair. That’s an example of the kind of event where connecting in person 
            could have been possible—especially considering he and I spoke last year at Deerfield Day, where he expressed support for this project. But since filing for re-election, it’s been 
            difficult to re-establish contact.
            <br>
            <br>
            As with every race, the goal here isn’t complicated:
            Filling out a candidate questionnaire, recording an introductory interview, and planning a more detailed conversation later in the season would take an afternoon or two at most.
            And it doesn't have to be created through my platform: If comprehensive info exists elsewhere, I'll just copy/paste it onto my website. That’s all it takes to give voters a 
            clear, consolidated, and accessible view of each candidate’s priorities—without having to spend weeks piecing together scattered appearances and social media posts.
            <br>
            <br>
            With all four candidates expected to advance to the general election, this is the perfect time for them to step forward, clarify where they stand, and make it easy for regular 
            voters to get informed.

                Description: A member of the New Jersey General Assembly serves in the lower house of the New Jersey State Legislature. Together with the State Senate 
                (the upper house), Assembly members are responsible for shaping state laws and overseeing matters that affect residents across all municipalities, not just one 
                town or city. Here are the key responsibilities of an Assembly member:
                <br>
                <br>
                Statewide Legislative Responsibilities:
                Assembly members draft, propose, and vote on state laws that apply to all of New Jersey. These may include bills on education, healthcare, public safety, 
                infrastructure, civil rights, and economic development. Unlike a township committee member, who deals with local ordinances, Assembly members help shape laws 
                that set statewide policy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Budget Review and State Funding Decisions:
                Members of the General Assembly help review and approve the state budget proposed by the Governor. This includes decisions on how much funding is allocated 
                to education, transportation, law enforcement, environmental programs, and aid to municipalities. They play a key role in determining where taxpayer money 
                goes at the state level.
                <br>
                <br>
                Constituent Advocacy:
                Assembly members represent the people of their legislative district—which includes multiple municipalities—and act as a bridge between local concerns and 
                state-level solutions. They help constituents navigate state programs, respond to policy concerns, and advocate for legislation that addresses 
                district-specific needs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Checks and Balances:
                While the Governor has executive power to enforce laws and manage state agencies, Assembly members serve as a legislative check on the Governor’s authority. 
                They can override a Governor’s veto (with enough support), conduct hearings, and introduce new legislation that counters or refines executive actions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Oversight and Accountability:
                Assembly members may serve on committees that investigate government agencies, hold hearings on state policies, and evaluate how effectively programs are 
                implemented. This role helps ensure transparency and accountability throughout the state government.
                <br>
                <br>
                Collaborative Lawmaking:
                Assembly members work with fellow legislators—including State Senators—to pass laws. Most legislation must pass both houses (Assembly and Senate) before 
                reaching the Governor’s desk for final approval or veto. Assembly members often sponsor or co-sponsor bills, building coalitions across party lines or interest groups.

                    The General Assembly race in New Jersey’s 3rd Legislative District features two seats up for election. While this district mostly covers Gloucester and Salem counties, 
                    it includes parts of Cumberland County representing about 17,000 people—so it deserves attention here.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the Republican side, Chris Konawel and Lawrence Moore are running unopposed. Like other local Republicans, they’ve often been accessible through the bi-weekly breakfasts in 
                    the past. But with those meetings now closed to non-Republicans, any updates that might have been shared there are no longer readily available to the wider public.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I tried to meet both candidates in person to help establish trust and open lines of communication. I attended a Harrison Township meeting specifically hoping to connect with 
                    Lawrence Moore, but he was absent that evening. Some of his colleagues said they would pass along my message and materials, but so far, there has been no reply. This is a 
                    good example of how cumbersome and hit-or-miss the process can be, even when you make the effort to show up in person.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I did speak briefly with Chris Konawel at a bi-weekly breakfast, so he is aware of this outreach and the platform I’m offering. But to date, neither candidate has provided 
                    detailed campaign information or followed up to schedule interviews. To be fair, Konawel did make some brief campaign-related statements at a breakfast and he does appear to be 
                    picking up steam on social media, but we'll see how it plays out throughout the season.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the Democratic side, Heather Simmons and Dave Bailey also ran unopposed in the primary. While I haven’t been able to connect with either directly despite multiple attempts by 
                    email, phone, and mail, it’s worth noting that Dave Bailey did make an appearance at the Cumberland County Fair. That’s an example of the kind of event where connecting in person 
                    could have been possible—especially considering he and I spoke last year at Deerfield Day, where he expressed support for this project. But since filing for re-election, it’s been 
                    difficult to re-establish contact.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As with every race, the goal here isn’t complicated:
                    Filling out a candidate questionnaire, recording an introductory interview, and planning a more detailed conversation later in the season would take an afternoon or two at most.
                    And it doesn't have to be created through my platform: If comprehensive info exists elsewhere, I'll just copy/paste it onto my website. That’s all it takes to give voters a 
                    clear, consolidated, and accessible view of each candidate’s priorities—without having to spend weeks piecing together scattered appearances and social media posts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With all four candidates expected to advance to the general election, this is the perfect time for them to step forward, clarify where they stand, and make it easy for regular 
                    voters to get informed.
