          <h6 class="page-title">Vineland School Board</h6>
          <p>Three seats are up for election on the Vineland School Board this year. Thus far, two candidates—Makema Douglas and Luz Vasquez—have officially announced their campaigns directly 
            to InformTheVoteNJ.com. Additionally, there is a circulating rumor that Bob DeSantos may also be entering the race, though that has not yet been confirmed.
            <br>
            <br>
            To help frame the key issues facing the board, we recently conducted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKBDqKGrFe8">podcast interview with sitting board member Rob Buono</a>, 
            covering a broad range of topics including school discipline policies, the Donaldson hearing process, academic performance challenges, and NJ Policy 5756. While this was a productive 
            and insightful conversation, we believe more voices are needed.
            <br>
            <br>
            To that end, InformTheVoteNJ.com is actively seeking interviews with other sitting board members, candidates, and informed community stakeholders to ensure that the public has a 
            clear understanding of the current challenges and priorities facing Vineland’s schools. Our goal is to help define the election’s key issues so that candidates can address them 
            directly and transparently.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although some may still view the election season as being in its early stages, Vote-by-Mail ballots begin going out on September 20th. To give voters ample time to review candidate 
            information and attend any potential forums or meet-and-greets, we are encouraging all candidate materials to be submitted by September 1st—now just a month and a half away.

                School board members are elected or appointed officials who serve on a school board, which is responsible for overseeing the management and operation of a public school 
                district. Their roles and responsibilities include:
                <br>
                <br>
                Setting Policies: School board members establish policies that govern the operation of the school district. These policies cover a wide range of areas, including 
                curriculum standards, school safety, student discipline, and more.
                <br>
                <br>
                Budgeting and Financial Oversight: The school board is responsible for approving the school district's budget. Members ensure that funds are allocated appropriately 
                to meet the educational needs of the students while maintaining fiscal responsibility.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hiring and Evaluating the Superintendent: One of the board's most significant responsibilities is hiring the district superintendent, who is the chief executive 
                officer of the school district. The board also evaluates the superintendent's performance and can renew or terminate their contract.
                <br>
                <br>
                Curriculum and Instruction: School board members have a say in the curriculum and instructional materials used in the district. They may approve or reject curriculum 
                changes, new programs, and textbooks.
                <br>
                <br>
                School Facilities and Infrastructure: The board oversees the maintenance and development of school facilities, including approving construction projects, repairs, 
                and improvements to school buildings and grounds.
                <br>
                <br>
                Policy Implementation: Once policies are set, the board ensures they are implemented effectively throughout the district. This includes monitoring compliance with 
                state and federal education laws and regulations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Economic Development: Commissioners often work on initiatives to promote economic growth in the county, including attracting businesses, supporting local agriculture, and 
                fostering job creation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Advocacy: School board members advocate for the needs of the district at the local, state, and federal levels. They may lobby for funding, legislation, or other 
                resources to support the district's goals.
                <br>
                <br>
                Community Engagement: Board members are responsible for engaging with the community, including parents, teachers, students, and other stakeholders. They listen to 
                concerns, gather input, and communicate the board's decisions and policies to the public.
                <br>
                <br>
                Academic Performance: The board monitors the academic performance of the district's schools and students. They review data and reports on student achievement, graduation 
                rates, and other key metrics to ensure that the district is meeting educational goals.
                <br>
                <br>
                Addressing Concerns and Grievances: School board members may hear and address concerns or grievances from parents, students, teachers, and other members of the 
                community regarding district policies, decisions, or individual school issues.

                Vineland voters will choose <strong>three School Board members</strong> in this year’s election. 
                Eight candidates are on the ballot seeking to guide the district’s direction and policies.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                Of the eight candidates, <em>Luz Vasquez</em> has been the most transparent and accessible, thoroughly answering our 
                questionnaire and participating in multiple radio interviews, including on our show. 
                <em>Francisco Santiago</em> provided a thorough response to our questionnaire and has been working to schedule time for an interview. 
                <em>Makema Douglas</em> gave a moderate response to our questionnaire, did a quick “man on the street” interview at the 
                Vineland Food Truck Festival, and plans a longer interview in October. 
                One other candidate reached out but did not follow up on our response.

                        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                            Some say public meetings often leave residents frustrated. Sessions can feel thin on actual business, with long executive sessions or ceremonial portions crowding out 
                            discussion, while the official business is sometimes wrapped up in minutes. Presentation quality also creates barriers—audio that is hard to hear, slides 
                            projected too far away, or statistics framed in a way that emphasizes positive trends without clear context. For example, readiness rates and absenteeism 
                            are often reported as “improving,” but voters are left guessing whether the gains reflect real progress or lowered standards. When meetings are hard to follow 
                            or data is vague, public trust in decision-making suffers.

                            <strong>Candidate Questions:</strong> Do you feel that the structure of school board meetings could improve? How would you improve the usefulness of public 
                            meetings—separating ceremonies from business, fixing audio/visual setup, 
                            and ensuring presentations are clear? Should data like graduation readiness, absenteeism, or proficiency be published with straightforward explanations rather 
                            than polished spin?

                            <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                                Residents frequently encounter a wall of rules and uncertainty about who can speak, what board members can say, and how questions are handled. Some community 
                                members even cancel appearances out of fear of being told they cannot speak on the record. Board members are also constrained by the perception that speaking 
                                publicly means “representing the board,” which creates hesitation to share individual perspectives. The result is a culture where communication feels like a 
                                scavenger hunt—piecemeal updates, unclear press access, and limited dialogue—rather than a two-way conversation. This discourages parents and voters from 
                                participating fully.

                                <strong>Candidate Questions:</strong> Will you commit to routine, on-the-record updates during campaigns and while in office? Should the board adopt a clear 
                                communication protocol so members can speak as individuals? How can information be shared so families and voters feel informed rather than stonewalled?

                                The superintendent functions as the district’s CEO and public face, yet in Vineland, some say the role can feel distant. Travel time, limited community 
                                appearances, and restricted interactions at board meetings leave some residents uncertain about who is leading the district day-to-day. If visibility and 
                                accessibility are limited, trust can erode, and the superintendent’s accountability becomes harder for the public to measure. Regular, structured communication 
                                and presence at community events could build familiarity and reinforce confidence that leadership is engaged and responsive.

                                in local events? Would you support a measurable communications plan that includes monthly updates, response timelines, and public-facing dashboards?

                            <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                                Vineland’s graduation rate is reported around 86%, but math readiness hovers closer to 35%. This raises blunt questions: Are students graduating without the 
                                skills implied by a diploma? The numbers are often drawn from different school years, which further clouds interpretation. Readiness tests are typically given 
                                in 11th grade, measuring 10th grade proficiency, but students can retake them through 12th grade or substitute alternate measures. Graduation rates don’t 
                                differentiate between those who passed on the first try, those who relied on alternate pathways, or high achievers. That means the data blurs whether diplomas 
                                reflect proficiency or persistence. Board members themselves have acknowledged that improving rates can be as simple as lowering the bar. Voters need clarity: 
                                are students actually performing better, or are loopholes creating misleading success?
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>Candidate Questions:</strong> How do you interpret the gap between readiness and graduation rates? Should the district publish synchronized data for 
                                the same cohort, with breakdowns by first-try vs. alternate pathway completions? Should achievement distinctions be introduced so the public can tell 
                                whether improvement reflects higher performance or just easier requirements?

                            <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                                Chronic absenteeism is a persistent problem in Vineland. Concerns have been raised about students with more than 50 absences—far beyond the state’s typical 
                                10% limit (about 18 days)—still graduating. Families point out that absenteeism often reflects deeper home challenges such as instability, health issues, or 
                                lack of transportation, but the broader community questions whether allowing extreme absences undermines both standards and fairness. Graduation rates that 
                                rise while absenteeism remains high can appear misleading, leaving voters unsure of whether students are being held accountable or simply passed through.

                                <strong>Candidate Questions:</strong> How should the district enforce attendance policies while also addressing root causes? Should parents be held more 
                                accountable—through pledges, contracts, or stronger intervention measures?

                            <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                                Vineland schools face the challenge of raising performance across the board while meeting the diverse needs of students. Families want to know that equity 
                                does not mean endless accommodations or diluted expectations, but rather that special education, multilingual learners, and advanced students all receive 
                                adequate support without lowering the bar for achievement. Special education needs are rising, resources are stretched thin, and multilingual families require 
                                both curriculum support and cultural respect. At the same time, career readiness, vocational training, and dual-enrollment opportunities are increasingly 
                                important for students who may not follow a traditional college track. The question is whether the district can provide individualized pathways without 
                                undermining the credibility of a Vineland diploma.

                                <strong>Candidate Questions:</strong> How should Vineland balance equity and high expectations? What additional supports are needed for special education and 
                                multilingual learners? Should career readiness programs, vocational training, and dual-enrollment opportunities be expanded?

                                Vineland has leaned on restorative practices to manage student misbehavior, emphasizing conversation and reflection rather than strict punishment. While some 
                                see this as effective, others worry that repeated disruptions, gang activity, and violent incidents are not adequately addressed. Teachers express concern 
                                that classrooms cannot function without consistent discipline, and families worry that well-behaved students are shortchanged when misbehavior is tolerated. 
                                A proposal has even surfaced to require parents to sign pledges committing to student attendance, preparedness, and behavior as a way to increase 
                                accountability. The broader question is whether restorative practices alone are sufficient or if firmer measures are needed.

                                <strong>Candidate Questions:</strong> Do you believe the district’s approach to discipline is effective? Should stricter consequences be introduced for repeat

                                Vineland has moved toward placing armed guards in every school, a decision that reassures some but concerns others. Supporters say visible security deters 
                                threats, while skeptics worry it shifts schools toward a punitive environment rather than a supportive one. Beyond guards, safety includes physical 
                                infrastructure like secure entrances, emergency planning, and attention to student well-being. Candidates will need to explain what balance they believe best 
                                protects students while fostering a positive learning climate.

                                The proper role of a school board is to set policy and oversee administration, not to manage classrooms or micromanage staff. Yet the line often blurs when it 
                                comes to test results, attendance enforcement, or disciplinary practices. In Vineland, board members may visit schools, but only with prior notice and under 
                                “non-evaluative” conditions. Some see this as an appropriate safeguard; others feel it limits authentic oversight. The debate reflects a larger question of how 
                                much access and influence board members should have within schools.<br><br>
                                <strong>Candidate Questions:</strong> Where do you see the line between policy oversight and micromanagement? What level of access should board members have

                                Boards often face state mandates that restrict local discretion. Policy 5756, which directs schools on how to handle gender identity and parental notification, 
                                is one example. Supporters say it protects vulnerable students; critics argue it forces schools to keep parents in the dark and raises fairness concerns in 
                                athletics. Regardless of position, many agree the board should explain clearly what rules come from Trenton and what authority the district actually has.

                            <p style="margin-top:10px;">
                                While day-to-day personnel decisions fall to administrators, the board is still required to approve hiring lists and occasionally rule on Donaldson hearings—
                                appeals by non-tenured teachers recommended for non-renewal. In practice, boards often defer heavily to the judgment of the administration when it comes to 
                                hiring and firing. This reliance raises a bigger question: if approvals are usually granted based on administrative trust, are board votes serving as a 
                                meaningful check or just a formality? And if they are only formalities, why require them at all? On the other hand, stepping too far away from administrative 
                                recommendations risks undermining the chain of command and creating inconsistency. The debate touches not only on the careers of individual educators, 
                                but also on staff morale, student outcomes, and the credibility of the board’s oversight role.

                                Public engagement in Vineland tends to spike during crises but remain low otherwise. When meetings draw large crowds, many speakers come from outside the 
                                district, raising concerns about representation and decorum. Rules about who can speak, time limits, and appropriate conduct are often unclear or 
                                inconsistently enforced, leaving both residents and outsiders confused. Stronger, clearer guidelines could help balance free speech with the need for 
                                meetings to remain orderly and representative of local stakeholders.

                                With local press diminished, voters lack consistent, unbiased coverage of school board races and district decisions. Residents are often left to piece together 
                                information from campaign flyers, word of mouth, or partisan sources. District-hosted, neutral resources could help level the field—such as a candidate 
                                questionnaire page with unedited responses, or recorded forums where every candidate answers the same questions. This would not only inform voters but also 
                                increase accountability during campaign season.

                                <strong>Candidate Questions:</strong> Should the district sponsor a “Meet the Candidates” page with identical questionnaires and unedited responses? Would you 
                                support recorded and archived forums with standardized questions?

                                Vineland graduates should leave school prepared not only academically but also civically and professionally. Yet civics is currently folded into general 
                                “social studies,” leaving many students unsure of how to navigate local government, ballots, or public meetings. At the same time, the economy demands 
                                practical readiness—whether through vocational programs, internships, or early college opportunities. Families and employers alike want assurance that 
                                students can graduate with both academic knowledge and practical skills.

                                <strong>Candidate Questions:</strong> Should Vineland restore standalone civics and local government courses? Would you support a senior capstone on 
                                government and voting? How should the district expand partnerships with local businesses, vocational schools, and colleges to improve career readiness?
