                    <div class="issues-sub-content">
                        This has been the most popular issue over the past several
                        months. As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, Senator Van Drew applied for
                        Cumberland County to receive a federal grant to upgrade our broadband infrastructure.
                        The full grant was approximately $35 million, which Cumberland County would need to
                        spend about $5 million of its own money. The controversy over moving forward on this
                        project was that the ‘middle mile’ grant only extends dark fiber around the general area
                        of the county but does not guarantee that any homes will actually be hooked up in the
                        future. That part would rely on internet companies such as Comcast and Verizon, or
                        individual residents, to finish the connection. There was also no feasibility study
                        finished. There was much passionate debate at county meetings on whether to move
                        forward or not, and finally the county commission voted in favor of moving forward.
                        Since the vote, Director Commissioner Albrecht informed me that the county is already
                        in talks to receive ‘end mile’ money, which would help individual customers to connect
                        their specific homes.

                    <div class="issues-sub-content">
                        There seems to be several problems revolving around the county jail. The
                        most obvious of which is an ongoing class action lawsuit about the mistreatment of prisoners 
                        during the pandemic. This seems to have led to some discussion about renovating the jail while 
                        focusing on issues such as mental health, rehabilitation, etc.

                        Nabb Ave is a road in Millville which is close to both its business and
                        industrial districts. Extending it is proposed to have an effect in which trucks delivering
                        goods via route 55 would have easier access, which might reduce transportation costs,
                        which could help overall business in the county.

                        The county seems to have outdated sewage and septic
                        systems, which leads to many problems regarding business development and home real
                        estate (such as building new homes or selling homes). I’ve been quoted costs
                        anywhere from $15,000 - $90,000 for sewage/septic upgrades of individual properties.

                        Cumnberland County has been working with Cape May County to promote general
                        tourism in the area. With Cape May already having an established tourism industry,
                        many tourists and vacationers book hotels in Cumberland County during their trips.
                        Both counties are working together to increase tourism in Cumberland County, as that will
                        help Cumberland County apply for state tourism grants, provide tourism packages for
                        both counties, and help develop business in both counties.

                        Homeslessness is on the rise throughout the country and Cumberland
