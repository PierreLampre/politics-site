                    <div class="issues-sub-content">
                        With the shutting down of newspapers all across the country, information regarding elections is scattered all over the 
                        internet and oftentimes appears biased because it is coming from the candidates themselves and their parties. The local paper,
                        The Daily Journal,
                        was absorbed by a parent company and the last reporter in the county retired last year. Without a trusted
                        3rd party entity providing objective oversight regarding issues facing the county, the public is left 
                        woefully uninformed about what is going on, especially in regards to local elections where biased political
                        messaging could be running rampant. While most of the candidates agree we need press coverage, none of them
                        seem to be particularly interested engaging in an action plan to fix the problem for a variety of reasons.
                        One candidate said "With the lack of press coverage, candidates are left to be their own press on social media." 
                        While we appreciate the pro-active approach to do something to get information out to the public, this approach could easily lead 
                        to the appearance of overwhelming bias and scattered sources of information... who has the time to
                        scour all the candidates social media pages, verify the facts, send follow-up questions that oftentimes go unanswered, attend 
                        various events that have entrance fees, etc etc etc? The press, that's who. Another candidate said "If I get involved in forming 
                        the  local press, it could be viewed as a bias for my party." Understandable, but we are still ultimately left uninformed. The 
                        public needs reasonable access to comprehensive, consolidated information regarding election choices. "We'll let the public know 
                        what we want them to know", this did not come from a candidate, but rather from a campaign organizer. It's pretty clear that we 
                        have a problem, but not necessarily anyone willing to solve it.

                    <h5 class="issues-sub-heading">Environmental Issues</h5>
                    <div class="issues-sub-content">
                        On the weekend of May 18th at the VHS Wellness Fair, we were able to speak with a representative of the Vineland Environmental Commission and dig into some of 
                        the environmental issues going on in the county.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Street trees not being replaced – When new construction is done throughout the city of Vineland, oftentimes trees are taken out during the process. 
                                While the city should replace these trees for overall beautification of the city and air quality concerns, oftentimes this is overlooked.</li>
                                <br>
                            <li>2. Stormwater - When it rains, the water that hits the streets brings out dirt and oils. Usually, this water goes into storm drains which hurts rivers and streams. 
                                We could instead build waterways that would redirect the water to the natural grass and dirt grounds, like lawns, which would act as a natural filtration system with 
                                the soil. Also, sometimes impervious surfaces which are not meant for certain areas, are created during construction projects because planning and zoning boards grant 
                                'variance waivers' for impervious surfaces. This basically means natural ground that would act as a natural filtration system for dirty water is instead replaced 
                                with surfaces like roads, concrete, etc.</li>
                                <br>
                            <li>3. Over-mowing - Many areas do not need to be mowed. But when we do mow them out of habit, we reduce the amount of pollinators. Pollinators are the type of 
                                vegetation that bees need to survive, and bees have been facing endangerment for a long time. A simple solution would be to raise awareness that many areas, 
                                like many roadsides, don’t need to be mowed.</li>
                                <br>
                            <li>4. Over-fertilization of ponds – Many areas near ponds have runoff during storms that gets into the ponds. Oftentimes this runoff has a lot of fertilizer in it. When the 
                                fertilizer gets into the pond, pond vegetation grows way too much, which needs to then be dredged (cleaned out), which is very expensive. Finding a way to prevent 
                                over-fertilization of ponds could save us a lot of money.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>5. Litter – Littering is still a big problem in the area and should be addressed. One interesting angle on this is the recent abolition of single use 
                                    plastic-bags. With that step, there was an immediate reduction in litter throughout the county. Similar steps could be made to reduce litter throughout 
                                    the county.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>6. ATVs – In addition to the common problems associated with ATVs (like dangerous driving conditions), oftentimes they also cause an environmental 
                                        problem. While there are some designated areas for drivers to use their ATVs, oftentimes people drive them wherever they want anyway, to the extent 
                                        where endangered vegetation areas are being ruined, even when signage is posted not to drive there.</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li>7. Local food – Oftentimes our local grocery stores are not using locally produced food. One example of this is that our local blueberries being 
                                            grown in Hammonton are being shipped down to stores like Publix down in Florida. Meanwhile, we are shipping in blueberries from other areas. 
                                            Food costs and gas emissions could be significantly reduced with better produce logistics.</li>
                                            
                        </ul>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="issues-card">
                    <h5 class="issues-sub-heading">Middle Mile Broadband</h5>
                    <div class="issues-sub-content">
                        This was the most popular issue over last year and continues to be a part of ongoing disucssions in the county. 
                        As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, Senator Van Drew applied for
                        Cumberland County to receive a federal grant to upgrade our broadband infrastructure.
                        The full grant was approximately $35 million, where Cumberland County would need to
                        spend about $5 million of its own money to qualify for the grant. Part of the controversy arose during public hearings about the 
                        project, where the 'true cost', meaning additional costs during years of implementation as opposed to the initial proposed cost, 
                        could add tens of millions, let alone maintenance costs after implementation.... so who would pay for that? Another part of the 
                        controversy over moving forward on this project was that the ‘middle mile’ grant only extends dark fiber around the general area
                        of the county but does not guarantee that any homes will actually be hooked up in the
                        future. That part would rely on internet companies such as Comcast and Verizon, individual residents, or 'end mile' grants to directly 
                        connect customers to existing infrastructure. With 'end mile' options available, some people feel that direct connections are a 
                        better method rather than a county-wide solution that is oftentimes redundant, meaning many areas around the county already have 
                        sufficient access to broadband. There was also no feasibility study finished, which implies the cost of the project could be 
                        significantly off. There was much passionate debate at county meetings on whether to move
                        forward or not, and finally the county commission voted in favor of moving forward.
                        Shortly after the vote, Director Commissioner Albrecht informed us that the county is already
                        in talks to receive the ‘end mile’ money, which could work in tandem with middle mile money we already received. The bulk of these 
                        discussions happened about a year ago in 2023, so perhaps it is time the public receives a progress report from the county so they 
                        can get a clear picture of how the project is going and how their tax dollars are being spent. This would be consistent with 
                        Commissioner Lod's statement during the vote (paraphrased), "We understand that the project is a risk, as many projects are. We can 
                        try going in this direction and if it doesn't pan out the way we're hoping, we can try something else."

                        goods via route 55 would have easier access to the business and industrial districts, which might reduce transportation costs,
                        which could help overall business in the county.

                        A representative from East Point Lighthouse gave a speech at a County Commissioner meeting on October 10th 2023,
                        regarding several issues surrounding East Point Lighthouse. Apparently the DEP has been causing blockades and 
                        giving a lot of runaround in regards to the lighthouse receiving funding for its upkeep. There was also much
                        discussion surrounding unequal treatment for the Eastpoint lighthouse in comparison to other lighthouses 
                        throughout the state. Under current management, the lighthouse has restored to a fully
                        functioning lighthouse which ships depend upon, and has become a historic landmark for tourists. However,
                        funding and support is needed for basic things such as bathrooms (there are currently none), adding walkways, 
                        and upgrading the current dirt road entrance to a paved road. These specific aforementioned improvements do not
                        even need funding, they only need to be approved by the DEP. Also, with the ever changing climate, rising 
                        water levels threaten to destroy the property. The lighthouse needs protection for this concern that other
                        lighthouses throughout the state already have.

                        Commissioners are responsible for things such as local services coordination, like overseeing the county veterans' cemetery, veterans ID card issuances, 
                        and being a liaison between veterans associations and the government. 
                        Being liaisons, commissioners should provide service referalls for local veterans and advocate for policies which would help local veterans. What visions
