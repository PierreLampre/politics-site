          <p>
            This year the Vineland Mayor seat is up for election, with incumbent Mayor Fanucci and former Mayor Romano in the race. As of today, 9/6/2024, 
            Fanucci has been very forward facing in the community and has contacted us with many details regarding his campaign, while there is very little 
            recent information available about Romano. Fanucci has a clear 5 point plan regarding his agenda, is aware of current issues and has a plan in 
            place to address them, and has a solid resume of experience to back up his ability to execute. We have come across one issue regarding 
            <a href="https://www.aol.com/state-tells-vineland-put-fired-075023140.html">lawsuits surrounding the police department</a>
            , which seem to have an ongoing investigation. We were able to make contact with Romano, but he was hesitant about sharing. Unless Romano is 
            willing to publicly make a case for himself, we believe it will be tough for voters to consider him over 
            Fanucci. Some of that may be done in upcoming radio time, which we posted on his candidate page on this site.

        <h4 class="sub-heading-ballot">What does a Mayor do?</h4>
        <div class="job-description can-sec">

            The role of a mayor can vary depending on the size of the city or town and the type of municipal government, but here are the general 
            responsibilities of a mayor:
            <br>
            <br>

            <details>
                <summary style="cursor:pointer; color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">Learn More</summary>
                Chief Executive Officer: The mayor is often the chief executive officer of the city or town, responsible for overseeing the day-to-day 
                operations of municipal government. This includes managing city departments and staff, enforcing laws and regulations, and ensuring 
                city services such as waste collection, public safety, and public works are running smoothly.
                <br>
                <br>
                Policy and Legislative Leadership: In many cities, the mayor plays a significant role in setting policy direction. They may propose new 
                laws, ordinances, and policies to the city council. The mayor may also veto council decisions, depending on the city's governance 
                structure. In some municipalities, the mayor presides over city council meetings and can influence legislative decisions through 
                advocacy and leadership.
                <br>
                <br>
                Budget Management: The mayor typically works with the city council and financial officers to prepare and manage the city's budget. 
                They allocate funds to various city departments, ensuring resources are used efficiently to meet the city's needs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Public Representation: As the public face of the local government, the mayor represents the city in public events, ceremonies, and 
                community gatherings. The mayor often interacts with local businesses, residents, and organizations to address concerns and promote 
                civic engagement.
                <br>
                <br>
                Crisis Management: The mayor is responsible for leading the city during emergencies or crises, such as natural disasters, public 
                health emergencies, or economic downturns. The mayor coordinates with local agencies and state or federal authorities to ensure the 
                safety and well-being of residents.
                <br>
                <br>
                Economic Development: In many cities, the mayor plays a key role in promoting economic growth by attracting new businesses, supporting 
                local businesses, and fostering job creation. They often collaborate with business leaders, developers, and other stakeholders to boost 
                the local economy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Law Enforcement Oversight: The mayor often has oversight of law enforcement agencies, including the police department. They may work 
                with the police chief to ensure public safety and community relations are maintained and may have a role in addressing crime and safety 
                concerns in the city.
                <br>
                <br>
                Intergovernmental Relations: The mayor acts as a liaison between the city and other levels of government, such as state or federal 
                authorities. They advocate for resources, grants, and support from higher levels of government to benefit their city.
                <br>
                <br>
                Visionary Leadership: The mayor often sets the long-term vision for the city, working with the community to develop strategic plans for 
                future development, sustainability, and overall improvement of the city's quality of life.
                <br>
                <br>
                Appointing Officials: In some municipalities, the mayor has the authority to appoint or recommend individuals for key municipal roles, 
                such as city managers, department heads, and members of boards and commissions.
