                He affirms that Vineland's students must have access to a high-quality, rigorous education that prepares them for success
                in career, college, and life. His goal is to place the school's academic culture first. He wants to represent the 
                consensus of Vineland's families values, beliefs, and traditions.

            <div class="policy-positions">
                He wants to prioritize subjects like language literacy and math literacy over topics like gender.
                <br>
                He wants to ensure that kids are prepared to compete for jobs with an ever changing demographic in the nation.
                <br>
                He wants to prevent and eliminate liberal, progressive indoctrination, such as critical race theory, gender identity, and transgender inclusion.
                <br>
                He will to protect and encourage students.
                <br>
                He will defend parental rights.
                <br>
                He will respect and support teachers, and the school support staff.
                <br>
                He will wisely spend tax dollars.
                <br> 
                He will follow family values built from Abrahamic principles.
                <br>
                Has quoted a law regarding that teachers should protect the welfare of the child as the parent desires. Says that 
                school systems and teachers are misinterpreting this law to effectively replace the parents.
                <br>
                Has mentioned that VHS ranked 330th out of 350 schools in the state, so he wants to hold the superintendent 
                accountable for the school's poor academic performance.
                <br>
                He says that school attendance is at about 85% and that this is not an acceptable standard. Imagine if you ran a 
                business and your employee missed approximately 1 day of work per week, that's essentially what 85% attendance yields.
                <br>
                Says that social engineering programs were snuck in during the Obama administration. He would rather "let children 
                be children."
