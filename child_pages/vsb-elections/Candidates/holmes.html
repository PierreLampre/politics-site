                My school board agenda is to ensure that our mission statement, policies and bylaws are held uprightly and strictly enforced. I also endeavor to make sure that I remain a relevant and consistent voice for our taxpayers, parents, administrators, teachers and most of all our students. I’ve made many connections and it is my hope to continue to build upon this.
                The agenda has already been accomplished within the last 7 years of my board term. I have been in the schools, spoken with countless constituents, ate lunch with kids to see what they would like to see implemented in our schools, etc.

                Most important issues would be finances and mental health. It’s always a burden to raise taxes and every year we are tasked with doing so because the increasingly high costs. Mental health for all of our students, staff and administrators and how it relates to morale is a big deal. We want to make sure students are excited to learn, teachers are enthusiastic about teaching, administrators are a shining beam of every school, etc.
